## First Moments
 Kevin is glowing, they seem to recoil instinctively a little. Opux raises his hand and says "HOLD".  Everyone obeys, but the three in front are looking back and forth between Opux, each other, and the party, in a way that indicates they are more jumpy than the rest.

Frita understands the creeper tongue, and it seems there is a *chance* to parley here.

Opux will attempt Dwarven first, ask if they speak it. Frita understands of course. If no one speaks Dawrven, see who wants to roll on A2.

If that fails, he wil try Golbinaderish, again see who wants to roll.

## If They Can Talk
Opux and crew are escaping crappy working conditions in Nilvyr. They don't have much of a plan, but do know Upworlders sometimes trade with Nilvyr and they show a sign of the Silver Hand. Their escape plan was patient and well executed, but their plan for the surface was... less so. Basically they hoped to find the only surface people they knew (Silver Hand) and buy/bribe their services in finding a better situation

If the party can find them a safe haven, they will make them the same deal (see treasure).

The sketchy three  look not so happy with this. Once this deal is on the table, they hiss at each other in heated tones, something like "your going to trade our only leverage before we even reaxh the surface or the people are are looking for?". Frita can understand but cant relay without giving away.

Each of the 3 make a reaction roll, unless the party intervenes ofc. If anyone of them roll a 6 or less, Initiiave! First one casts Dark, all thre two will attempt to backstab the party. Opux and the other 3 will not attack, but its kinda a reverse morale check scenario. if the party loses people, they might decide they are right and the time for parlay is over.

## If they Can't Talk
Almost certainly a fight.
