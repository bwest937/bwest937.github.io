- mention [[Dragon Shit Sword]]
- mention hirelings
##### dc encounter prep
i think remove the baddies and track them on graph paper, but also can use a black circle for visual indicator

#### Whats going on back in the dungeon
- DCs discussing next move, they carry a token of a silver hand and have a vague notion they can seek help from them
- realize someone was in the dungeon and they may have limited time
- begin digging in the furniture room?
    - let the 1-way door close so they can't be sneaked on
    - leave 3 guarding the horde and the hole in the power room
