## Items thoughts

- Some sages keep a **Two-Tailed Coin** in their money boxes. Their killers are ill-fated, for those who carry the coin, easily overlooked in a purse, see beautiful lights and light-tempered beauties in the depths of every body of water. They must save or be tempted down into the warm embrace of the depths, getting +1 for each reason they provide for why they must pass by. They can never repeat reasons, even on later saves.

## [[Banditos]]
might rotate to other campsites, city of barakus has the greentree bandit info and helps

## maps etc
- update region map (gemstone mountains? branchfolk?, other settlements?)

## dragon cave
barakus area Q goes right in there i think!

## Sometime
- [ ] Fancy arrows fom d12 9 is a good vendor or thing a hunter can do

## Rules suggestions
- [ ] on wilderness encounter check with no encounter, provide a clue to hex monster/ecology
- [ ] hunters surprised only on a 1 outside?
- [ ] critical hit /miss= -1 AC for target  of hit, -1 to hit for miss (or it gets save?)
    - [ ] mundane gear needs repaired, what does that look like? 
    - [ ] how about magical items? 
        - [ ] no need to track it if it doesnt end up damaged, thats bad design for us
        - [ ] resist damage num times = item's + bonus  per fight? 
        - [ ] or im
        - [ ] regular bsmith can repair, but some % of being broken? or need to find magical armorer... tricky


## monsters to stat


## possible monsters, consult for reloads too

outside
- snatching serpent

dungeon
  - maybe make the knight guy a kam warrior (4hd splits into 2hd, splits in 1hd)

manor
  - bad guy might have a kraben raven as familiar
  - vittora might be hanging out in his place too. cool familiar actually.


troglydyte den and/or mining dungeon
  - molecricket, giant

swamp
  - tangleworms, maybe during ratdog fight

ratdog disease might be this:
The rotting disease does not allow the victim to heal naturally unless cured (by the spell cure disease) and does an additional 1 hp of damage per hour after contracting the (necrotizing) disease until the victim is dead.

-dule tree
ghostcap bloom (from bfrpg field guide 2)
