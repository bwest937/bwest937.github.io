Dragon Scale This is a large intact dragon scale. You can remove 3d6 of them from each corpse. Eight intact plates can be fashioned into a set of plate armor. It is not considered a magical armor, but grants a +10 AC bonus and imposes a -5 stealth test. The user must have a strength of 15 or higher. It costs about 2,000 gp to commission a blacksmith to create this armor for you.

## Temple

## Items 

- Some sages keep a **Two-Tailed Coin** in their money boxes. Their killers are ill-fated, for those who carry the coin, easily overlooked in a purse, see beautiful lights and light-tempered beauties in the depths of every body of water. They must save or be tempted down into the warm embrace of the depths, getting +1 for each reason they provide for why they must pass by. They can never repeat reasons, even on later saves.

## [[Banditos]]
might rotate to other campsites, city of barakus has the greentree bandit info and helps

## maps etc
- update region map (gemstone mountains? branchfolk?, other settlements?)

## dragon cave
barakus area Q goes right in there i think!

## Sometime
- [ ] Fancy arrows fom d12 9 is a good vendor or thing a hunter can do

## Rules suggestions

- [ ] hunters surprised only on a 1 outside?
- [ ] critical hit /miss= -1 AC for target  of hit, -1 to hit for miss (or it gets save?)
    - [ ] mundane gear needs repaired, what does that look like? 
    - [ ] how about magical items? 
        - [ ] no need to track it if it doesnt end up damaged, thats bad design for us
        - [ ] resist damage num times = item's + bonus  per fight? 
        - [ ] regular bsmith can repair, but some % of being broken? or need to find magical armorer... tricky

## Dismemberment/Permanent Injury
GoldenRod Guide has tables as good as any, but flesh this out and talk over with group before instituting.

## Class advancement past 4
GoldenRod Guide has some great fighter options. thinking at level 6 they get weapon specialization or a style. could be at level 4 instead of full 2nd attack too. obviously not all styles make sense.
