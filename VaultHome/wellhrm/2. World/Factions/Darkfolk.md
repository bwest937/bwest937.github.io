Seven escaped [[Dark Creeper]] from Nilvy
## Description
They stand just under 4 feet tall, always swathed in heavy, dark cloaks and wrappings. Their flesh is pale and moist, and their eyes are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul stench of sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily to the fact that they never take off their clothing—instead piling on new layers when the outermost one grows too ragged.

Speak their own tongue and some Dwarven.

### Nilvyr

A Dark Creeper city, known as Nilvyr, exists deep within the Deep Dark, resting on one edge of the Sea of Endless Night. Ruled over by a cabal of Dark Stalkers, it is home to over 100 Dark Creepers, as well as a small troop of Myconids who tend the mushroom and fungi fields.

The Dark Creepers are sent out to find crystals (and other magical items) for their masters - the Dark Stalkers - who use them to power their magic 

### Skills
- Four of them worked in the royal workshops, and the other were miners. Mining including tunneling but also ranging around to find crystals and other resources. 
- Opux is an especially skilled magic crystal craftsman. Weapons defniitely.
Taken together they can tunnel efficiently, have some tinkering knowledge (digging machines) and make (magic?) daggers. Otherwise just see what the party whats around those strengths,


## They Want
First a safe haven. Then?
