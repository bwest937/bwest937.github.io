## Description
THEY MOVE WITH A PRIMAL, UNPARALLELED GRACE. 

A humanoid the color of tree-bark, with hair like leaves in the wind, moves between the fens and groves with an unearthly ease. They wear sparing clothing, woven from grass and vine bearing tools of rock and bone. Their eyes are like pools of starless night and their hands end in twisted fractal twigs. 

THE DRYADI, OR BRANCH-FOLK, ARE AN ANCIENT RACE OF TREELIKE BEINGS. 

They make their homes deep in the Wilds, hunting game and foraging for food amongst the terrors that lurk in the dark. Each one lives to be many centuries old and are incredibly dangerous if they perceive you as hostile. 

THEY LIVE IN TIGHTLY KNIT TRIBES CALLED GROVES, EACH ONE BOASTING 10-100 MEMBERS. 

Most of the community members work as hunter-gatherers, with a few of the older members serving other commu‐ nal tasks. Each member of the Grove is expected to be able to hunt and fend for themselves if needed, meaning each member is usually a capable fighter in a pinch. 

WHEN NOT HUNTING, THEY CAN BE FOUND WORKING ON STRANGE AND ELABORATE CRAFTS. Due to their lengthy natural lifespans many of them dabble as artisans, creating masterful tools and artifacts. Occasionally, a Dryadi will be seized with an innate need to create, a mood colloquially referred to as “taken by the Wyrd,” which causes them to go somewhat mad in feverish creation. These members are called “Wyrdshapers” and their artistry and skill is absolutely unparalleled, in‐ deed, even mythic and powerful at times. 

THEY ARE NOT AN INHERENTLY DANGEROUS OR CRUEL FOLK, but can be driven to unspeakable acts of vioence if their community is endan‐ gered or attacked in any way. Stories abound of military camps and border villages being razed in a single night after a Dryadi is killed intentionally or by accident. After the screams die down and the sun rises, the sur‐ rounding trees will be decorated with the victims of the raid.
