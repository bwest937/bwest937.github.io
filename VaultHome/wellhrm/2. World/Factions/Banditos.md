# Banditos

  

## Name

When asked, they say they used to be called "Harris's Hulking Highwaymen" but now are going by "The Titanic Troublemakers". If it comes up again they are constantly changing the name (Mouserat joke from Parks and Rec) and might even argue about it.

  

- The Grown Grabbers
- Harris's Highway Haunters
- The Verdant Veil Highwaymen
- The Looming Larcenists
- Abigail's Road Rascals
- The Outsize Outlaws
- Harris's Hefty Horde
- Full Size's Formidable Fiends
- The Mouldering Mist Marauders

  

## Tactics

The bandits generally patrol/ambush on the road with half their numbers, one mounted. They have two horses, Abby is always on a horse and a netter usually has the other. The rider will block the road w/ two mooks and demand a 100s from each person for "safe passage". If refused, the rest of the mooks step out with their xbows trained on the victims. Two thieves are usually lurking, and will backstab and/or pickpocket if they get the chance.

  

### Parley

They will accept the 100s or rough equivalent

  
## They Want

- a long-lasting name
- enough loot to scrape by
- to avoid serious fights
- stretch goal: to eventually get enough resources and renown to join a larger criminal org

  

## Leader:

Abigail "Abby" Harris, aka Full Size, is capable and inspires loyalty in her mooks, but is also well aware the overall morale of her gang is relatively low and 20 hungry outlaws could turn on her if things get dire. Her Growth Ring inspires rumours of her being a giant. If her gang is mostly wiped out or otherwise dealt with, she *might* recruitable.

  

## Camping
rotate between A2 and A4. maybe C4 sometimes, or split sometimes?

- Move: 12
- Attacks: +3 to hit: Bow 1d6+2, Longsword 1d8+2
- Special: 2 melee attacks on odd # turns, Growth Ring

#### Growth Ring

Allows the wearer to double his normal height and weight. This increase in mass affords the player a +3 bonus to damage rolls (melee only). The ring wearer may maintain the the size increase for up to 1d6+1 rounds. After this time (or whenever they want), the ring wearer reverts back to his regular size.

This change in body mass is a strenuous shock to the system and after returning to his normal size, the ring wearer suffers damage equal to the # of rounds his size was increased.

Usable by: all classes.
