A mostly empty island, but kids dare each other to gather the goose berries that grow on the eastern side of this small island. They make excellent pie and have a curious green tint. Gallos marks the east side as **DANGEROUS**. There are fishfolk in the lake and they lay their eggs here in the spring. Fishfolk mostly keep to themselves but they are very territorial and aggressive this time of year. He mentions in passing there is also a weird old dolmen here.
