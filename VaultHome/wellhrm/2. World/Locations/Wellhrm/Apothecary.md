## Description
The apothecary is ran by *some person*. She is happy to talk shop if the party takes the time, and will offer to buy or trade for some key ingredients that the party might forage. She can probably help with mushroom or other drying if they ask.

## Stock
If they are out of stock, best bet is to find some raw ingredients where applicable. But they can also check back in some time, and market day probably has an impact as well.
