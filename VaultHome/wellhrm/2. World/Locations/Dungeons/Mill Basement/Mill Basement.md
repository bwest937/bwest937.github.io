## Dungeon Key

In this dungeon, the stonework is competent but not up to Dwarven standards. Basic and unadorned except for where mentioned. There are places for torches, very plain, in the public hallways and rooms.

**1. ENTRANCE ROOM:**

The tunnel you have been crawling through opens into a room about four feet from the floor. The room is 30' by 30' with exits to the north and south. There wall is collapsed into rubble in northeast corner, looks like it might have been stairs.

- Robes, vaguely priestly or religious in nature, hang on a rack on the wall. They are extremely old and nearly disintegrate if touched.
- Next to the robes there is some kind of small wash basin. It's not valuable.
- By the north door there is a pile of filthy black rags, these are not the same as the robes hanging nearby. 

##### Exits
- The south exit is a stuck door with a framed with a stone arch. At the top, the arch reads simply "The Dead". If inspected, there are a pair of small holes on either side (4 total), that shoot darts at anyone who opens the north door without disarming the trap.
- The north exit is also an arch, it reads "The Holy". It is unlocked and there is no keyhole or lock, but it is **trapped**. 
	- If the wall around the door is inspected closely (esp with tapping/knocking), the catch that disarms the trap is found.
	- Dwarves get 1/6 chance to notice passively something amiss about the stonework?
	- If the trap is not disarmed, 4x darts (1d3) fire from the arch. 1d4 of the darts still have some paralyzing poison, save +2 (vs poison or paralyzed) or be paralyzed for 1d6 turns.
	- If opened, mention some **scratches** on the floor when describing the hallway (secret door)

**Hallway 1 --> 6:**
This hallway has no sconces/torch holders other than those described in 3 by the pit traps.Not well traveled recently, body aside. Describe the smells from the body and rotting room as appropriate.

**2. HIDDEN SHRINE:** The secret door to this room has a cleverly designed lock, **hidden behind a swiveling nub of rock**. The key is on the corpse in the southernmost pit in area 3, below; otherwise, it could be picked normally.

The secret door opens to a brightly lit room that was turned into a makeshift shrine. The cold stone walls are decorated with chalk symbols and a makeshift altar made from a large wooden crate covered in a moldering white cloth holds a simple golden chalice. On the far side of the room, there is a figure mostly obscured by the altar.

The room was blessed as a sanctuary by a long-dead adventuring Cleric. The Cleric's body is behind the crate in a kneeling position, facing the altar, still clutching her holy symbol. 

Clerics will recognize the symbol as a very old form of their own, this appears to be the final resting place of a cleric of Gael.

She is nothing more than barely held together skin and bones. Her gear is long gone, except for her holy symbol and the tattered remains of her robes.

The room itself will detect as magical and is under the effect of a permanent **protection from evil** spell (as a 6th level caster) and a permanent **light** spell.

- The golden chalice is a minor relic that allows a cleric to make holy water 1/day (takes 1 level spell cast). Worth 100gp if sold for gold.
- The holy symbol is a minor relic that allowed a cleric to re-roll any ones made during a Turning attempt. Worth 20gp if sold for silver.

> [!hint]
> Explain [[Philanthropy]] here
> If they can get the remains back to [[Father William]], worth 500 xp. Another 300xp if the relics are also donated.



**3. THE PITS:**

As you round the corner, you smell the strong odor of death. Ahead you see an open pit. A very narrow ledge leads around it on both sides.

There are two pits in this section of hallway. On either side of pits there is a sconce on the wall, make sure to mention them.  They are the only sconces in this hallway and function as the switch to disarm the pits. 

- The western pit is open as described above. It is 10' deep, and thus does 1d6 damage to anyone falling into it. Any character attempting to cross on a ledge must roll a Dexterity ability roll to avoid falling in. If inspected, it looks like a trap door (same as armed eastern pit).

- The eastern pit is covered by a very well hidden trap door that will open if 100 or more pounds of weight are placed on it (such as a character walking on it). It will spring closed in a single round after opening. Anyone falling into this 10' spiked pit takes 1d6 points of damage for the fall plus 1d4 points of damage from the spikes; a saving throw may be rolled to avoid the spikes. In the bottom of the pit is the corpse of an adventurer, dead about three weeks. On his body is 3 gp, a short sword, a key (to area 2), and a **Potion of Healing**.

**4. CENTIPEDE ROOM:**

> [!cite]  As the party approaches this room, read the following
>
It's hard to distinguish from the smell of death, but a different stench, like a midden or a rotting garbage heap is coming from ahead.

Both doors into this room are **stuck**, and both are rotted through at the bottom. 

##### Exits
- west door is **stuck**, bottom rotting out
- eat door is **stuck**, bottom rotting out

This room is about knee-deep in rotting debris, but otherwise apparently empty. This might have been food storage, but its real gross and hard to tell.

The room can be crossed in perfect safety by simply wading through. However, a character poking around with a 10 ft pole, spear or whatever has a 1 in 6 chance per round of disturbing a nest of 2 [[Centipede, Giant (Man-Sized)|Giant Centipedes]].

**5. OCTAGONAL ROOM:**

The oddly shaped room has doors in the west and south walls. Although faded beyond recognition, these walls show the first signs of decoration since going through the Holy door. The floors are littered with splintered wood and pottery, the remains of furniture. If they investigate, they might put together at least some of this was a scroll rack, perhaps undermined by vermin.  

*This is where the creepers will begin digging if they are left alone for too long?*

If the party spends two turns searching, inside  the remains of a some kind of shattered pottery they find a portion of a once- larger scroll still intact. It has **clerical scroll of Light** (one use). 
##### Exits
- both doors are easy to open


**6. Priestly Bunk:**

The room is laid out like a bunk room of sorts, with beds stacked floor to celling on the west side. The beds have been gnawed on but still standing. There  is a side table, 2 chairs and a table with a weird old version of chess. The board is in bad shape but the pieces are in remarkably good shape (50gp, 1/3 slot). The east wall is covered with tapestries (rotting, illegible and no value). 

- Behind the tapestries is a small alcove with a [[Bag of Holding]], holding a [[Water Walk Potion]].


##### Exits
- north door is open
- south door is unlocked and easy to open from inside the room, but is a **secret one-way door**

**Catacombs #3:**

### Make sure your on the right Catacombs

![[less cavey catacombs.png]]`
The walls of this room are lined with small alcoves, 20 in total. Each alcove is piled high with bones, and with shards and splinters and fragments of bone-as far as you can tell, mostly human. 

- The ceiling is decorated with a deteriorating stucco mural that appears to be of a religious nature. Judging by the CHECK OUT THIS HIGH GYGAXIAN SHIZZ: *steatopygous muliebrity* of the deity depicted, perhaps she is some long-forgotten goddess of fertility and death.

##### Exits
- to the west it is open to the passage, no door
- to the north, the faint outline of the secret door may be detected (elves and dwarves get passive chance?). it cannot be opened from this side.
- to the south the passage is open, no door. the **arch** here says "Journey"

##### Alcove Treasure Table
10 alcoves can be searched by one person in a turns, roll on below table to determine result

**H3 Journey Hallway:**
This hallway to 12 used to have frescoes on the wall depicting a hero's journey, but most of the plaster is gone. There are torch holders although empty. The light from 12 is only apparent after turning past secret room 13.

**Catacombs #2:**

There is an exit to the west and to the east.  The walls of this room are lined with small alcoves, 20 in total (same table as **C3**). Each alcove is piled high with bones, and with shards and splinters and fragments of bone-as far as you can tell, mostly human. 

- The ceiling is decorated with a deteriorating stucco mural that appears to be of a religious nature. Judging by the CHECK OUT THIS HIGH GYGAXIAN SHIZZ: *steatopygous muliebrity* of the deity depicted, perhaps she is some long-forgotten goddess of fertility and death.

##### Exits
- to the west it is open to the passage, no door
- to the east it is open to the passage, no door
- to the north, it is open to the short passage ending in the door to 8 (unlocked, not stuck).
	- **arch** that says "Power
	- Successful listen check will here the creepers in 8.

**8. Creepers On The Run:**

Listening to this door will reveal a lot of quiet, hissing speech coming from multiple voices (if the party hasn't made too much noise).

Upon opening the door, you see 4 creepers sitting around a small fire in a circle (they need heat and food) discussing something.

When the party has a chance to look around the room, they see the following:

The room itself features well-crafted busts on pedestals (four against the north wall and four against the south, 8 total) of old and venerable visages, there are ragged tapestries on each wall, but they are quiet ancient and rotten. There is a door in north wall.

The creepers are hiding out after having stolen treasure from the Nilvyr royal workshops. 

- **The Hole:** In the north west corner of the room is a hole. Next to it (south) is some kind of infernal machine (Holler Hammer from Lowlife) and a half-full bag of black powder (east). If the BP is detonated it does 3d6 within 5', 2d6 within 10', 1d6 within 20'. Creepers have a 1/6 chance of being blinded for a round.

are two bags, each tied to a four foot long pole for carrying between two people: one holds 967 (weird, rectangular) sp (in one) . Each has and additional 3d6 sp on their person.

100 a slot for this money, its worth 10x (so worth gold basically, but heaver than normal)

The busts are plaster with thick layers of paint, which itself is darkened and old. Their value is roughly 15 gold pieces each.

**9. STOREROOM:** The lock on the heavy wooden door leading to this room is visibly broken; only a few twisted, rusting pieces of iron remain. The door swings open easily. The place was once a storeroom but most of its contents have long since been looted. Now it contains a small patch of **Green Slime** on the ceiling.

*As you stand in the doorway of the next room, you notice that the ceiling glistens in the light of your torches. You see an unlit room, about 10' square, that is mostly empty. The remains of some broken barrels and crates lie scattered along the walls and in the corners The floor of the room is dusty around the walls. In the middle of the room it looks relatively clear, and you see a faint glinting, a reflection of the light you're carrying, apparently from some small objects lying in the middle of the room.*

Upon closer inspection these prove to be the badly corroded buttons and buckles (roll on Midderlands Crap table maybe) from the clothing and gear of the last victim of the Green Slime that clings to the ceiling. It has been a while since the Green Slime has eaten. It occupies a 5' x 5' area in the center of the ceiling and is easily visible to anyone who looks upward with a good light source or Darkvision. The creature will detect and attack the first character venturing into the center of the room (for instance, to examine or retrieve the metal objects on the floor). It will also attack any pole or similar object that is used to test the floor.

**Green Slime:** Green slime isn’t technically a monster, just an extremely dangerous hazard in underground tombs and other such places. Any metal or organic substance it touches begins to turn to green slime (saving throw).  It burns through clothing in 2 rounds, through leather in 4 rounds, and through metal in 3-6 rounds. If a Green Slime comes into contact with flesh, it immediately begins to transform it’s host. Within 1d4 rounds, the victim becomes a green slime themselves with no chance of resurrection. This can be avoided if the Green Slime is scraped or burned off the flesh within 1 round of contact. Of course, scraping or burning the slime off of it’s victim will cause the victim some damage. It can be killed with fire or extreme cold, and the transformation process can be arrested by the use of a cure disease spell.

**Catacombs #1:**

The walls of this room are lined with small alcoves, 20 in total. Each alcove is piled high with bones, and with shards and splinters and fragments of bone-as far as you can tell, mostly human. 

- The ceiling is decorated with a deteriorating stucco mural that appears to be of a religious nature. Judging by the CHECK OUT THIS HIGH GYGAXIAN SHIZZ: *steatopygous muliebrity* of the deity depicted, perhaps she is some long-forgotten goddess of fertility and death.

##### Exits
- to the north it is open to the passage, the **arch** says "*Knowledge*". The door to 11 can be seen. It is **locked**
- to the west,  it is open to the passage
- to the east,  it is open to the passage
- to the south the passage is open, no door. the **arch** here says "*Light*" and a soft glow can be seen coming from the end of the passage

**H4 Catacomb Hallway C1--C3:**
This hallway is decorated with skulls (nothing to be found) and torch holders, seems a little more traveled vs the H1 hidden hallway. The floors and walls are worn smooth, perhaps from many pilgrims passing through. 

**11. HOBGOBLIN'S FORMER ROOM:**

This 30'x30' room is carved from greenish stone and layered with carpets and tapestries, and all manner of decorated pillows lay strewn about. There are a couple books strewn about.

![[Oracle Sludge.png]]

allow a lore check

- A *stone* **oracle sludge** is here. Resting on top is a **cursed scroll**. If this scroll is inspected or read, save or be *Turned to Stone*. Needs a 6th level MU to reverse, so that's a whole thing. [[Quinn Bakersfield]] can probably help.
- Elsewhere in the room is a **pile of clothes**. If searched there is a [[Medallion of ESP]] in the clothes. It appears the wearer was absorbed by the sludge.
- The books are **cook books, 2 slots worth**. If a PC spends a week of downtime with these, they get a permanent +1 die to cooking rolls.



**12. ROOM OF GLOWING SKULLS:**

As you enter this octagonal room you are struck by an odd sight. Each wall has a small niche in it, and in each of them is a glowing skull. The creepers avoid this room.

The skulls are cemented into the walls. If a player character tries to remove any of the skulls by brute force, there is 90% chance the skull will be destroyed. Tools and or care will reduce the chance. If a [[Thiefers]] attempts it, the usual chance to Pick Locks is applied; failure results in a 50% chance of the skull being destroyed. Each skull generates illumination as if affected by a *light* spell. This effect is permanent and will probably be useful against the creepers.


**13. SARCOPHAGUS ROOM:**

The latch to the secret door is hidden by an illusion, any hands-on check of the area reveals it.It opens to reveal a twenty foot square room. A large stone sarcophagus rests in the center of the room. A skeleton stands in each corner of the room, each one gripping an ancient spear, but all remain motionless.

The skeletons only move and attack if they themselves are attacked or *the sarcophagus is touched*.

The outside of the sarcophagus is covered with carved images a man in robes casting spells at an array of foes. A search of the sarcophagus reveals no traps, and the lid slides easily off. Once opened a **magic mouth** spell activates and says:

*Much did I plunder from the dead, now it is my turn to be plundered. May my last baubles serve you as they have served me.*

A single skeleton lies in the sarcophagus, dressed in the tattered remains of a once fine robe. It wears a jeweled ring on its right hand, and a plain silver ring on its left hand. If tested, both rings detect as magical; the jeweled ring is a **Ring of Protection +1** and the silver band is a **Ring of Fire Resistance**.

**14. The Statue**

There a roughly life-sized statue of a female figure. She is wearing robes and has her hands out. It's unclear if this is the same deity from the ceilings in the catacombs in a different form, or a something else entirely. There is **offering bowl** at her feet. There is 23 ancient rectangular silver coins (1gp each) and a large star rose quartz (65 gp) in the bowl. 
- Surrounding the statue (and bowl) is a ring of 9 [[Warding Stones]]. If anything passes over them, they begin to shake and glow for 1 turn, creating a loud enough clatter to provoke an encounter roll. Moving a stone out of place stops the effect.
- Any offering made by a Lawful PC will cause the statue to cast *Protection From Evil* (evil monsters -1 to hit target, target +1 to saves from those attacks). Lasts two hours.
