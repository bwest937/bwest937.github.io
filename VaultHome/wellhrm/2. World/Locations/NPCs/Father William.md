**Roleplaying**: 
- Arches his eyebrow a lot, at least when he talks to the party.
- Severe demeanor, but willing to help the party with healing magic (for an appropriate donation). Just as importantly, he is content to look the other way wrt arcane magic usage.

Father William knows some healing spells. His magic is slower and more ritual in nature, plus he reserves some magical energy for congregation. Net result is he can only cast one of (Cure Disease, Remove Curse, Cure Blindness) once a week.

| Spell          | Cost  |  Time  |
| -------------- | ----- |:------:|
| CLW            | 50gp  | 1/day  |
| Cure Disease   | 150gp | 1/week |
| Remove Curse   | 150gp | 1/week |
| Cure Blindness | 150gp | 1/week |

Sells Holy Water for 25gp/each (max once a week due to it being a slow process). This improves if the chalice is donated.
