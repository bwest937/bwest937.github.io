1 6 HD [[Marsh Troll]] is in the act of tattooing a 1 HD [[Marsh Troll]]. The party can watch and learn something, the 1 [[Marsh Troll]] troll casts (whatever spell) upon completion. Clerics in the party recognize the spell and should be able to puzzle out what is happening. 

Interrupting almost certainly causes a fight!

Watching the entire ritual without getting into a fight is worth 600 XP.
