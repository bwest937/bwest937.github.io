From amongst the dangling willow fronds a small statue of an old man regards the characters serenely. Slightly unnervingly, its blank eyed gaze seems to track their every move. At the statues foot, a spring bubbles into a very small pond/cove (connected to the lake).

[[Highland Shaman]] recognize the statue as a version of [[Treeman]].

Scattered in the mud at the bottom of the pool are hundreds of silver and gold coins, which if even so much as a single coin is taken will bestow a curse on the offending character(s). 

This curse will invoke the immediate summoning of 3 3HD [[Thorned Briarling]] who will demand that the characters restore the money to the pool. The [[Thorned Briarling]] will try to persuade the party of the foolishness of their actions, and will only attack in response to an attack upon themselves or unless the party attempts to leave the pool area.

**The Curse:**
- If the coins are returned, the curse is immediately lifted.
- If the briarlings are slain the curse will remain, and manifest itself in that the offending characters will mysteriously lose 10% of their wealth per week, regardless of any precautions they might take (treasure will even “evaporate” from securely locked vaults) until such time as the characters restore what they stole from pool.
- If the statue or pool are desecrated or vandalised in any way, the curse will be invoked and persist until such time as the damage has been restored. The curse can only be lifted by a high level cleric.
- 
**Detect Magic:** A detect magic spell if available will reveal two separate magical aura's surrounding the shrine. 
- One emanates weakly from the statue and pool area generally
- A second more intensive field is located within the pond

**In The Pond:** An investigation of the second aura will reveal an ancient broadsword nestled beside the ribcage of a partially disarticulated skeleton. The sword will in the fullness of time prove itself to a +2 broadsword (if used sufficiently). Should anyone make the mistake of lingering in the pool for more than a few minutes,  a KUROK-SPIRIT comes for them.
