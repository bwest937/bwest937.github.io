The sinkhole is 100 ft across and 20 feet deep. Not really a pond at the bottom, but if its been raining will be wet.

On the sides of the sinkhole a good amount of valuable looking amethyst crystals are visible. For every hour a PC with a pick spends mining, get 2d20 gp worth of crystals. 8 +1d4 hours worth of crystal is present.

If they look closely, or when they get in the sinkhole, they notice a few  large-cat sized tunnels/burrows. Two Slitherats hang out here, sometimes. Roll 6d6 for every hour, any one = the sliterats show up. Desrcribe their teeth!

Slitherats are a bizarre variant of the giant rat, sometimes found in places with heavy crystalline mineral deposits. These rodents have a long (4ft) snakelike body covered in fur, with four almost vestigial legs on each side. The long body tapers into a ratlike tail at the end, adding another foot to the creatureâ€™s overall length. The head, although large, is clearly that of a giant rat; but the long front teeth glitter, for they are made of thin, sharp diamond. Because the teeth are so hard and sharp, slitherats attack with a +1 bonus to hit, and inflict 1d6+1 damage. These strange creatures use their teeth to dig through earth and solid rock when they encounter such obstacles, but they pass through crystal as if it were not even present, leaving no trace of their passage. **The diamond teeth from a single slitherat are worth 250gp.**
