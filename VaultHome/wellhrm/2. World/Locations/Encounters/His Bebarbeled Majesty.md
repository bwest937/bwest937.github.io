Heaving with ragged, slurping sounds a gargantuan slime-coated catfish wallows within the shallows ahead...

His Majesty has found Himself in this predicamentâ€¦due to chasing some fishfolk who got too close to the King's perceived territory.

Reaction roll to see his attitude, but he wants help regardless.

If the party helps him get turned around, he offers to increase a PCs CON or STR. To receive the, boon, one must be swallowed and live for a week and a day inside His gullet.

Helping takes at least an hour, it is loud messy muddy work turning this behemoth around, and will provoke an encounter check.

Refusing to help will result in the King placing a subtle curse on the party...  all catfish is poison (Remove curse can handle it). Maybe they catch a dragon eating him later if they come back this way lol.

Figure out stats only if needed,
