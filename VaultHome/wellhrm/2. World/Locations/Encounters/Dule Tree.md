 

## On search

A little off the road, you notice the remanants of... a road? Perhaps the old Gorman road originally took a slightly different path. Folowing the intermitten traces of the road leads large tree.To actually get to the tree requires pushing through some undergrowth revealing a small clearing underneath the boughs of the old sycamore maple (aka Scrottish maple).

  

As you look around, you suddenly hear a voice from above you ask "Oi, what you are lot up to?"

  

## Jack

"Jack" is chilling on top of a large bough. He seems charming and profoundly relaxed. This the old dule tree (hanging tree). He is actually a ghost, hung here hundreds of years ago at the old location of the crossroads. He is wearing an impossibly cool coat. He is extra chatty with any Thievey types, but offers to trade tales with anyone who will listen.

  

### Jacks tale

His tale is an embellished version of his final caper, in which a daring rogue called John the Borrower (with the power to turn invisible, no less) "liberates" a massive hoard of gold and jewels from a dastardly nobleman, only to be betrayed by his partner. He is eventually captured outside of Wellhrm and hung on this very tree, then buried nearby, as was the custom for criminals in in that time. But it is said they never found all of the treasure...

  

### Jack wants

To have his corpse moved to the actual cemetery. If he likes the tale and/or the party, he will ask to be moved to the cemtery in exchange for his treasure. He understands this is a dodgy operation and is ok with no headstone, but does want a blessing from a aligned Good priest or cleric (not picky about the deity). He knows the odds of some serious unded being encountered are pretty high for anyone who goes digging for his corpse, but does not disclose this.

  
  

## Digging up John

  

https://carolinamemorialsanctuary.org/how-to-dig-a-grave-by-hand/

  

If the party has the exact location, it will be easier.

  

Jack's grave is pretty deep. Digging it up will requires a shovel, and will be easier with a mattock.

  

Each mattock adds +1

Heavy armor -1

Wet ground or fog -1

  

1 PC digging with a shovel can get through the topsoil in 6 hours (encounter checks might happen), with base 5/6 chance of making the digging roll.

  

Each additional PC with a shovel lowers the time needed, up to 4 (2 = 3 hours, 3 = 2 , 4 = 1.5 hrs).

Each digging PC must make a digging roll.

  

Failed Digging Roll

Roll 1d20, go down the table compare roll to stats (use lower of the stats if more than one):

STR/CON: You over-exert, and your current tool snaps: it’s useless until repaired.

DEX: An errant shovel swing catches the back of your (or someone else's) head. You suffer 1d4 damage.

INT/WIS: You misplan your dig, and it partially collapses. It takes another hour to dig it out to the right size.

CHA: Your spite and irritation is palpable: for 1d4 hours, no one else will dig with you.

  

When they complete digging, two things happen at once. They hit the rotted out boards of the box Jack was buried in, and he exclaims with glee. Also, a rotted hand emerges from the side of the grave and grabs a PC by the leg.

  

However they react, ghouls (or zombies? skellies?) begin awakening all around them. It seems there were some more recently deceased fellows in shallower graves, and they too are restless.

  

**Figure out this encounter**

  

## Burying Jack

Moving the body (likely in sack, 1 B slot) takes normal movement points. Digging a grave here half the time, assuming his bones are in a bag. The ground is automatically wet, -1 to digging rolls. Cleric can bless him before they cover him up. Takes the same amount of time as digging the hole, but no digging role needed.

  
## If...

they dig him up and bury him, but dont bless him... the coat is mildly cursed, and the wearer has -1 to all rolls (contract magic baybee)

  

party digs him up and takes his stuff without burying him, they will be haunted by his ghost (figure that out then) + the coat curse

  
  

## Might be interesting if...

They are noticed messing about in the graveyard (Looper bros? Lannan? A priest?). Some rumours would be spread, lowering their reputation for sure. If they do this during the day, this MUST happen.

  

- Jack's Coat is a Clandestine Coat:

This black leather long coat is sought after by Thieves and other characters who favor stealth and misdirection. Counts as +1 magical leather armor.

It contains six small pockets sewn into its inner lining that cannot

be discovered unless the wearer wishes to reveal them. Each pocket leads to a tiny dimensional pocket capable of holding an item

weighing no more than a few pounds, such as a single dagger, a set

of thief ’s tools, or a dram of poison. No matter how diligent they are

searched, neither the pockets nor the items contained therein will be

revealed. Finally, the wearer of the Clandestine Coat receives a +2

bonus on all saving throws to resist damage from or avoid the effects

of any mundane or magical traps they encounter.

  

    the pockets are not revealed initially, but a thiefer type that dons the coat will find in them:

  

        - BAG OF ENDLESS CALTROPS 5x/Day

        - Bag of tricks

        - Ring of Invisability, Faulty

        This ring grants the wearer all the benefits and

        limitations that are bestowed by an invisibility spell.

        Unfortunately, this Ring of Invisibility is faulty and has

        trouble maintaining its invisibility granting powers.

        Every 1d3 rounds, the ring wearer using this ring will

        unexpectedly become visible for 1d2 rounds, after

        which, he'll return to his invisible state. Usable by: all

        classes

        - 100 cp total in the remaining three pockets lol
