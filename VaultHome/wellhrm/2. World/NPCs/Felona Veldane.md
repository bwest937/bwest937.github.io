**Appearance**: Human w/ short mousy hair.
**Roleplaying**: Always complimentary
**Background**: Felona run a neatly kept cosmetics and jewelry shop with husband [[Tom Veldane]]. They are relative newcomers to Wellhrm, having lived here only half a dozen years, and they still feel lonely and friendless. Will disclose rumours to anyone who bothers to chat. Sometimes eat together at the Inn. Perhaps they were horse thieves in another life (one decent heist --> capital to open the shop)?
