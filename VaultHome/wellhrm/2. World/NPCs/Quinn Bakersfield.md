## `=this.file.name`

**Status:** If [[Gloomberries]] are returned, +1 to.. reaction or whatever rolls

**Appearance**: A middle-aged good looking human male. Looks the part of the miller with a flat thumb and all, although he seems a titch more fashionable than strictly required with his sturdy boots and flour-dusted apron.

**Roleplaying**: 
- Has a habit of "scanning" everyone that enters his establishment, low-key Bourne style.
- Generally agreeable, impressed with/reacts to perceived competence.

**Background**: This section is narrative in nature. You can let it breathe a bit more than the other sections if you’d like, but a little will still go a long way. I tend to think of this in terms of _essential context_ and _interesting anecdotes_. Is it something that will directly influence the decisions they make? Is it information that the PCs are likely to discover about them? Is it an interesting story that the NPC might tell about themselves or (better yet) use as context for explaining something? Great. If it’s just a short story about some random person’s life that you’re writing for an audience of one, refocus your attention on prepping material that’s relevant to the players.

**Key Info**: 
- Running a secret MU school, gets acolytes up to 1-2nd level at most
- Is also a legit miller
- Not interested in adventuring himself, but believes strongly in the democratic/leveling power of magic.
- Once good relations are established, can ID magic items for 250 gp. Takes a day. For higher level or weirder stuff, pick a % success rate and be upfront, might do partial success ("its +2 and not cursed, has some elemental affect")

**Stat Block**: Is probably a level 2-3 MU.
