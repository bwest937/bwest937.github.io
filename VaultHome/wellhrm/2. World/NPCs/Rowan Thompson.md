**Silver Mine:**
Was a real going concern. Closed right around the time of my birth, but I had awareness of it as a child. Folks spoke of it mostly fondly, but it was pretty clear there was something odd and sudden about it closing. My research indicates The Wrenwalks benefitted from it greatly of course, it being in their county, and assisted with securing resources for it. Whatever happened there probably can't be blamed on the Lord t, as it was another 20 years since he was last seen when it shut down.

**Wrenwalk mansion:**
Wrenwalk probably had good intentions, as far as lords go anyways, but after the irrigation fiasco his behavior became increasingly erratic. Eventually the dark clouds gathered, rumours swirled, and a few folks died (or never came back anyways). Wellhrm learned to avoid the place and it did enable our limited independence so it wasn't all bad. 

Most folks think the ghost of the Lord Wrenwalk still haunts the place. They arent exactly wrong, but I dont think they are exactly right either. I suSilveespect he has turned into something more dangerous, but that's just my intuition. Be prepared to deal with the undead if you plan on visiting that place. You might even consider seeking out Father George, but you will have to get to him early before he is completely in his cups."
