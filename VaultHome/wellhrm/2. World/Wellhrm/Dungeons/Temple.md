A kam warrior is a supernatural being that, when killed, splits into two separate warriors which both then “rise from the dead” and continue to fight. A kam warrior begins as an 4 HD monster (and saves as a fourth level fighter). When killed, it arises as two identical (but individual) kam warriors, each with 2 HD (each fighting and saving as a 2nd level fighter) (magic items will not split; one kam warrior will receive the magic item and the other will receive a normal/nonmagical version of the item). When a 2 HD kam warrior is killed, it rises as two 1 HD kam warriors (duplicating possessions as above, each fighting and saving as 1st level fighters). When a 1 HD kam warrior is killed, it does not “split,” and simply dies. (Note to DMs: to completely kill a 4 HD kam warrior requires killing 12 HD worth of monsters.)

When he dies, he turns to a pile of dust but the magical sword remains. +2 neutral intelligent (can speak to wielder) broadsword, cast [[Phantasmal Force]] 1x day.
