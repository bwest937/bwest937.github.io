This place is a good mill and wonderful bakery, but it's also a secret magic school. This is why there are ~8 young and interesting looking people working at such a boring place. They are basically level-0 MU, maybe with Detect Magic or one other spell. They all wear a pin or necklace with *a wheat stalk subtly curving into a stylized gear*.

Ran by Quinn Bakersfield, a middle-aged good looking human. No apparent wife, but his place is staffed mostly with younger folk. 

## Wants
Quinn wants the party to deal with the Dark Creeper problem in his basement, but he isn't sure they are up to the task. As long as intros go well, he instead asks them to retrieve 4 slots of [[Gloomberries]]. If they do so, he will bake them a [[Gloomberry Pie]] that will help with the poison the Creeper's are so fond of. He sends one of his acolytes along to "help pick the best ones". They are there to help and observe, and won't fight unless they absolutely have to. They will help carry stuff however.
