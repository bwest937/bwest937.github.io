grab bag:
    - Tentacle â€“ A long and agile third appendage sprouts from your torso. Lasts a day. (rubbery, tastes like squid)
    - Fleeting Journey You teleport to a point within sight. At the end of your next turn, you teleport back. Looks like water. Smells like bread. When you try to take a small sip, the liquid teleports out of your mouth and back to rejoin the bulk of the potion.
    - Breathlessness You no longer need to breathe and are immune to gases. You cannot speak or cast spells. Lasts 30 minutes. Looks like milk. Not only does it have no smell, it actually prevents you from smelling anything for a few seconds. A small sip briefly paralyzes your lungs
