The ground in a 20-foot-wide clearing is burned and blackened. A rotting, hollow tree trunk lies on the ground, its entire side bubbling with a green syrupy liquid. Other trees standing around the clearing are missing bark on the sides facing the clearing. Grass around the edges of the clearing is withered and brown. A giant sunflower lies across the clearing, its stem burned in half. A giant bee lies crushed beneath the fallen flower. The upper half of the bee has been burned away. The entire area smells of nail polish remover. A giant beetle colony lives under the clearing. The opening into their colony is inside the fallen tree. 

Two [[Beetle, Oil|Oil Beetles]] wait for creatures to enter their clearing, then anything that approaches the area with their oily blistering liquid through holes in the hollow trunk. They rush out opposite ends of the tree to attack, clicking their mandibles to bring 3d4 [[Beetle, Fire|Fire Beetles]] from the underground nest.
