## Hanging Was Too Good for Him 

On a peaty moor frequented only by ravens, scrawny ebon hares and the timid priests of the god of the scythe, one might have the misfortune to 

You come across a low pool of water. Ravens circle overhead. There is a small runic pillar that appears to be marking the pool. Clerics recognize the runes as related to [[Mephistophael]], otherwise a #lorecheck might suffice. 

The pool is home to a bog [[mummy]]. The mummy was a common thief that was strangled and thrown into the holy waters that are marked with a runic pillar. The bog mummy has leathery, slate colored skin, dead eyes and stark white hair. It still wears the rope that hanged it, and has thin, atrophied arms and legs that, despite their appearance, are horribly strong. When it opens its mouth to groan, a thick, distended tongue lolls out. A terrible visage to be sure. 

Bronze rings, bracelets, anklets and torques have been cast into the waters of the pond, and 1d10 x 100 gp worth of these goods can be found with an hour of uncomfortable searching. 

>[!info] The Weight of Judgement (+1 Fused Ring-Knuckledusters) 
This mass of stolen rings fused with gloomium and mineral deposits seems to whisper faintly when held underwater. Each ring belonged to a different victim of the thief, now merged into an instrument of divine punishment.
Wearing the rings prevent any other rings, magical or not, from being worn on that hand.
>On a successful unarmed strike, the rings emit a deep tolling sound. The target must make a save or be briefly haunted by visions of their worst deeds. The visions feel like drowning in their own memories. If they fail, they automatically go last in the next combat round, and have a 60% chance to drop whatever they are holding.
>The wearer's dreams are filled with visions of [[Mephistophael]] punishing the wicked. Suffer -1 resting mod.
>The wearer smells faintly of swamp pond water.
