### Grappling 

Grappling a reasonably-sized opponent is resolved as follows: The attackers (or attacker) make individual to-hit rolls. The grapple is resolved among those who hit: Each combatant rolls 1d6 per hit die. 
- If the sums are exactly equal, everyone is struggling, and none of them can attack with a weapon
- If the sum of the dice of all the attackers is higher than the defenderâ€™s total, the hapless defender is [[Grabbed]]. 
- If the defender wins, the attackers are beaten back and must make a save or be knocked [[Prone]]. 

In subsequent rounds, if the attackers wins the grappling contest against an already [[Grabbed]] opponent, the defender is [[Pinned]].

> [!example]
> Five orcs attempt to overwhelm a 5th-level Fighter, each orc rolls to hit. Let us assume that two of them succeed on the to-hit roll. The orcs roll a total of 2d6 (each orc has 1HD), and the Fighter rolls 5d6 (the Fighter has 5HD). The orcs get a total of 10, and the Fighter gets a total of 15. One of the orcs fails its save, so ends up [[Prone]] on the ground. The other orc is beaten back, but can act normally next round.

#### Grapplers Being Attacked

Any character who has a defender [[Grabbed]] or [[Pinned]] can choose to release their victim to defend against the attack normally. If they choose to keep the grapple, attackers get +4 to their to-hit rolls.


##### Design Notes
Mostly SW, but with some BECMI thrown in for a little more granularity and detail on how to handle situations.
