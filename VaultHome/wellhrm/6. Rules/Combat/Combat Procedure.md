# Combat Procedure

When the party of adventurers gets into a fight, the order of events is as follows:

  
### 1 Surprise

The DM determines if a surprise roll is required, and if so, both sides roll to see if they are surprised by the sudden encounter. See *Party Skills* for details.

  

### 2 Declare Actions

Certain actions must be declared before Initiative is rolled (the DM makes a similar determination for the opponents):
  

- #### Charge
	Surprised characters cannot charge
- #### Total Defense
- #### Cast a Spell
	
	A spellcaster cannot be in melee when they declare their spell.  The spellcaster can't move or do anything else on their turn when casting. Thus, if the enemies win the initiative roll and damage the spellcaster, the spell’s casting may be disturbed and the spell lost.
	
	
	**Exception**: A caster may decide to ready a spell **before** combat breaks out, in which case the spell can be cast on their turn without declaring and they get their normal actions (including deciding to cast another spell). This is risky since any damage or anything else that might break Concentration risks losing the spell before combat even starts.
- #### Missile Fire
	Anyone planning on shooting a missile weapon should say so now. The DM might remember to track ammo this way.


### 3 Resolve Charges
Any charges are resolved simultaneously. If charging foes meet, their relative speed will determine where they clash. Any charging combatant who has the misfortune to charge into a foe with a polearm will suffer a free attack (also applies to polearms in the second line).

### 3 Roll Initiative

Each side rolls a d6 and the side with the highest result is the winner. 

**Guerilla bonus**: The side with the fewest members gets a +2 to their roll.

One roll is made for each side, not for each individual. If this is the first round and one group was surprised, the other side gets to go first automatically, without having to roll a die. Ties go to the players!


### 5 Stationary Missiles 1
The side that won initiative resolves any missile fire from stationary shooters. Then side that lost initiative resolves any missile fire from stationary shooters.

### 5 Winning Side Actions
First, the side that won initiative moves, attacks, resolves spells, uses items, or anything else they can do. These actions can be coordinated amongst the members of the winning side and be done in any order they wish (except for second or third missile attacks, these are resolved last). Members of the winning side may also choose to holds their initiative, to wait and see what the enemies do, or declare some kind of trigger ("I shoot any Orc that moves where I have a clear shot").

### 5 Losing side

The side that lost initiative moves, attacks, resolves spells, uses items, or anything else they can do. These actions can be coordinated amongst the members of the losing side and be done in order they wish. Members of the losing side do not have the opportunity to hold initiative or setup triggers.

### Stationary Missiles 2
The side that won initiative resolves any second or third missile attacks from stationary shooters, then side that lost initiative resolves does the same.

### 6 Held Initiative

Anyone who held initiative or has unresolved triggers may now act.



## Morale

Each monster has a morale rating between 2 and 12, with 2 representing creatures that absolutely don’t fight and 12 representing mindless creatures that always fight to the end.

There are two times when a morale check is called for during combat: when a side loses its first casualty, and when they lose half their number in combat to death or incapacitation (including sleep, paralysis, etc.).

#### Procedure

To make a morale check, the DM rolls 2d6 for each monster (or NPC) on the side, and if the result is higher than the creature’s morale rating, the check is failed and the individual surrenders or retreats.
