## Gloomium Exposure

Exposure to unusually strong amounts of gloomium may have unpredictable effecs.
  

### Gloomium Dice

Arcane and natural casters that spend at least a turn in a "gloomium hot" area (as designated by the DM) will Â gain a [GD] (gloomium die).

[GD] act as [MD], with two limitations:

- **Duration:** The [GD] lasts for 1d6 x level turns. Unused [GD] dissipate harmlessly.
- **Mishap Risk:** If you use a [GD] and roll 1 or 2, you must make a roll on the Mishap table.

  

### Combat

Combat in or near a hot area affects all sides equally, barring specific immunities or magical effects. Somewhere between once a combat and once a combat round to determine the precise effects.

Roll 1d4 on the following table to see what kind of rolls are affected.

> [!example] Hot Combat
>The party gets into a fight near a large pool of water that is glowing olive green and giving off a gloomium-infused vapour. When the fight begins, we roll a 1d4 and get a 3, so **all saving throws** are affected. Then we roll 1d6 and get a 5, so **all saving throws** get a **+2 bonus**.
