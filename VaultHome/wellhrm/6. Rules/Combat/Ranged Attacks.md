Foes are considered at range if they are outside of 5ft of each other.

### ROF (Rate Of Fire)

For weapons with a ROF of > 1, the attacker must not take their move action in order to take the extra shot(s). Small amounts of repositioning, such as popping out from cover, are fine. The second and/or third attacks will be resolved at the end of the turn, after everyone else has acted.

### Ranged Attacks Through Multiple Ranks of Allies
Ranged attacks attempted through more than one rank of allies are usually made at *disadvantage*. If the attack misses, the GM will roll to randomly determine what ally the attack might hit and another attack roll is made vs. the ally.

> [!example]
> A halfing with a crossbow is in the rear of an 8 member party exploring a cramped dungeon hallway. Ahead, the fighters are suddenly engaged in melee with some giant centipedes. Attempting to shoot through multiple ranks of allies will be at *disadvantage*. They shoot and miss, and the poor mage in the middle ends up the target. Another attack roll will determine the mage's fate!

#### Exception: Set Defense / Shield Wall
Ranks of allies that [[Set Defense]] this round can be attacked over without issue.

### Ranged Attacks When In Melee

Attacking with a ranged weapon when in melee is possible, but difficult. The attack role is made with *disadvantage*.

### Ranged Attacks Outside of Range

Ranged weapons have an effective range specified. Attacks made between 100-200% of this range are possible, but difficult. The attack role is made with *disadvantage*. Attacks beyond 2x the effective range are not possible.


### Ranged Attacks Into Melee

Attacking with a ranged weapon against a target in melee is not without risk. If the attack misses, the GM will roll to randomly determine what adjacent creature, if any, the attack might hit. If needed the shooter makes another attack roll against the new target.
