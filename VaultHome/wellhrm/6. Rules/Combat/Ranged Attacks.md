Foes are considered at range if they are outside of 5ft of each other.

### ROF (Rate Of Fire)

For weapons with a ROF of > 1, the attacker must remain stationary in order to take the extra shot(s). Small amounts of repositioning, such as popping out from cover, are fine. The second and/or third attacks will be resolved during the [[Combat Procedure#Second Missile Volley|Second Missile Volley]].

### Ranged Attacks Through Multiple Ranks of Allies
Ranged attacks attempted indoors through more than one rank of allies are usually made at *disadvantage*. If the attack misses, the GM will roll to randomly determine what ally, if any, the attack might hit.

> [!example]
> A Halfing with a crossbow is in the rear of an 8 member party exploring a cramped dungeon hallway. Ahead, the fighters are suddenly engaged in melee with some giant centipedes. Attempting to shoot through multiple ranks of allies will be at *disadvantage*. They shoot and miss, and a roll indicated the poor mage in the middle ends up the target.

#### Exception: Set Defense / Shield Wall
Ranks of allies that [[Set Defense]] this round can be attacked over without issue.

### Ranged Attacks When In Melee

Attacking with a ranged weapon when in melee is possible, but difficult. The attack role is made with *disadvantage*.

### Ranged Attacks Outside of Range

Ranged weapons have an effective range specified. Attacks made between 100-200% of this range are possible, but difficult. The attack role is made with *disadvantage*. Attacks beyond 2x the effective range are not possible.

### Ranged Attacks Into Melee

Attacking with a ranged weapon against a target in melee is not without risk. If the attack misses, the GM will roll to randomly determine what adjacent creature, if any, the attack hits.
