### Set Defense
All your efforts this round are put towards defending. In return, you get +2 AC, +1 Save until your next turn, and a free attack if an opponent [[Charge|Charges]]. Multiple PCs with shields can create a shield wall this way. 

#### Shield Wall
The shield wall is a protective formation made by warriors standing side by side locking their shield together to form a “wall.” It provides protection to those behind it. Any creature attempting to attack anything within the shield wall makes to-hit rolls at a -4 penalty. Creatures attacking with missile weapons must make check (4 in 6) to see if they bypass the wall before rolling to-hit.
