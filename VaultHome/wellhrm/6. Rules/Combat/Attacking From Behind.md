Any attack made from behind has a to-hit bonus of +2, or +4 if made by a [[Thiefers|Thiefer]] or similar. There are only two ways for most people to get behind someone during combat. One is to surprise an opponent and attack from behind during the surprise action. The other is to attack an opponent from behind when an ally is attacking from the front. Thieves can get behind a target during normal combat if they successfully [[Hide in Shadows]], even if no one is attacking the target from the front.
