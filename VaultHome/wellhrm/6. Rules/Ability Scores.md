#### Prime Abilities

Each character class has one or more prime abilities- scores of special importance to that class’s function. A character’s score in their prime ability affects how quickly they gain XP.

  
### Strength

High Strength lets the character hit more often with melee weapons and for Fighter-types only, high Strength gives bonuses to inflict damage. Strength also helps with certain skill checks, most notably with opening stuck doors.
  

### Dexterity

A high Dexterity score gives your character bonuses when attacking with a bow or other missile weapon, and improves your Armor Class making you harder to hit. 
  

### Constitution

A high Constitution gives your character extra hit points for each hit die. It also helps you when making death saving throws!



### Intelligence

High Intelligence is especially important for Magic Users and provides a better chance to learn new spells, to know a language, and to recall facts about the world and its inhabitants.
