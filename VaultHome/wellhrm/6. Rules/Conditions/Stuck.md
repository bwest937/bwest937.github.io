>Getting stuck means you are unable to move forward or backward in the passage: you’re stuck. You can move your arms and legs about, and maybe wiggle a bit, but you can’t walk, crawl, climb, or otherwise move. Trying to swing a sword or cast a spell is difficult, as is reaching any new gear. Trying to do anything contingent on movement, like run or dodge, is impossible.
> ##### Getting Unstuck
>  **The one important rule in getting unstuck is: you cannot free yourself without a change.** Your own faculties alone won’t work—that’s why you’re stuck in the first place. That change can be friends, tools, the passage, whatever: you just can’t make a check and be free.

> Possible means of getting unstuck include:
> - Breaking inconvenient bones.
> - Help from a comrade.
> - Greasing or oiling the passageway.
> - Carving off strips of flesh.
> - Chipping away at the rock face itself.
