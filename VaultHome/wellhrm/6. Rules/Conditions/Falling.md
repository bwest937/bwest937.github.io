>##### Falling When Roped On
>If you fall while roped on, you take damage equal to the distance you fell until the rope stops you. 
>
>For example, if you fall 30’ before the rope halts your fall, you take 1d20 damage. Dynamic rope is stretchy, and thus prevents this.
>
>##### Potion Breakage Rules
> Whenever you take falling damage, each of your potions has a 50% chance to break open (rolled individually). If any of the potions react with objects, apply it to another random object. For example, sovereign grease could spill on your stowed rope, or a potion of invisibility could spill on your spellbook. 
> Its possible to wrap potions up so that they are not at risk of breaking. Wrapped potions take up 1 inventory slot each (instead of 3 to a slot)
