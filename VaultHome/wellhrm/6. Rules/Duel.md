### Potato Juice
Big Owge challenges a party member to a game of ‘Potato Juice, Potato Juice’. The game involves two players trying to fill a pint bottle with potato juice by smashing potatoes against their forehead. 

First to fill the pint bottle wins. Big Owge gets to roll d6 cuz he fucking loves this game. If a player wins, they gain the intense animosity of Big Owge for eternity.

#### Each Round
Roll 2d4 + CON

natural 2 = save or knock yourself out
natural 8 = flourish (two potatoes at once, etc)

total = ozs produced


target = 16 oz
