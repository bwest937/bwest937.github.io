On Griffon-having hexes, roll 1d30 **+5**

| d30   | Griffon Location                   |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| 1-20  | Not here                   |
| 21-26 | Adjacent hex (see diagram) |
| 27-30 | Here                       |


```
 26 /   \  21
25 |     |  22
 24 \   /  23
```
  
If here or adjacent, and the party can see that far, narrate what the Griffon is up to.
- 4/6 chance the griffon has found local prey, if that makes sense.
- And/or roll on [[What Are The Monsters Doing]]
