## Bookeeping
1. Spend points 
2. Update time (*one point = 4 turns*)
3. Check weather

## Enter Hex
Describe the hex. Think about exploration path vs traversing path. They can see roughly 2 hexes across, but there are often tree and weather in the way.
### Griffon/Events 
Describe the Griffon or any other automatic events and resolve. "Vibes" encounter checks happen here probably.
### Exploration

1. Roll encounter check
> [!hint] Wilderness Encounter Checks
> - Provide a clue to hex monster/ecology if no encounter comes up
> - Check distance and what monster is doing
> - Consider Griffon or any other interactions
1. Describe anything found and resolve
2. Roll forage
3. Fishing if applicable (More than an extra hour spent fishing or doing anything else calls for another encounter check)
