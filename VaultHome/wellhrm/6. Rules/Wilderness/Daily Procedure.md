Before heading out the party should...
- know exactly what they have on them and how much money
- know if they are out more than 8 hours they will incur fatigue


1. Determine wilderness encounter checks 
	 - Roll 1d6, 1d10, 1d20. Discard any >8 and any dupes. Encounter checks happen sometime during the hours indicated.
2. Verify and describe weather
3. If adventuring more than 8 hours or out and about more than 12 (4 hours chill time), the  party is Fatigued (1 slot/ every hex)
