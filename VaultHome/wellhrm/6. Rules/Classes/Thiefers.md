#### Thief Skills
Thieves have the following unique skills: 

![[Find or remove treasure traps]]

> [!skill] Hide in Shadows
>  Thieves have borderline supernatural sneaking skills. Anyone can hide, of course, but thieves can hide in nothing but a shadow. Additionally, in some circumstances Thieves may roll this check after the rest of the Party is Surprised to see if they can dive for the shadows and stay hidden.

> [!skill] Move Silently
> Thieves have the skill to move silently (i.e. making absolutely no sound whatsoever). Non-thieves cannot sneak unnoticed in silent environments.
> **Silent environments:** Moving silently is required to sneak unnoticed in a completely silent environment. e.g. if a guard is standing quietly listening for intruders, a roll to move silently may be required. 
> **Noisy environments:** Thieves can sneak unnoticed without a roll in environments with background noise (i.e. where moving absolutely silently is unnecessary). This includes combat. 
> **Failed rolls:** A thief who fails their roll to move silently is still assumed to be moving quietly, thus the normal surprise rules apply). 

> [!skill] Open Locks
> Thieves’ expertise with small, complex mechanisms allows them to pick locks. 

> [!skill] Pick Pockets
>Thieves are trained in the subtle art of picking pockets. The chance of success is reduced by 1-in- 6 per three levels of the victim (e.g. a 6th level victim reduces success by 2-in-6). A roll of 6 means that the attempted theft is noticed. 

> [!skill] Read Languages
> Thieves can figure out the gist of most written languages and comprehend treasure maps or written documents. 


**Base chance of success**: All skills begin with a 1-in-6 chance of success.
 **Expertise points**: Thieves gain expertise points to improve their chance of success with their skills. Each point allocated to a skill improves the chance of success by 1-in-6. Multiple points may be allocated to a skill, further increasing the chance of success. For example, if 2 points are allocated to a skill, the chance of success is raised to 3-in-6 (from the base 1-in-6 chance of success). At 1st level: At character creation, a thief has 4 expertise points to allocate. Gaining levels: A thief gains 2 additional expertise points to allocate. Maximum chance of success: No skill may be raised above 5-in-6.
