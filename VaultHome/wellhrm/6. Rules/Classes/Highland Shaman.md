### Description

The face of a Highland Shaman is intricately inscribed in blue woad tattoos and their hair and beards are plaited into long braids. They cover their weapons and shields in fetishes and charms and paint them in patterns of blue and white. Wearing animal skins and carved deer skull helms, they strike a ferocious and animalistic figure on any field of battle.

Whether fighting with their clans or smaller groups, they inspire fervor in their companions. This is often the reason why the clans are victorious in battle.
