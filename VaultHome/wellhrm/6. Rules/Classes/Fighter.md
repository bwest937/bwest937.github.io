### Description
Fighters are adventurers dedicated to mastering the arts of combat and war. In a group of adventurers, the role of fighters is to battle monsters and to defend other characters.


### Combat
With no weapon or armor restrictions, multiple attacks, and the ability to protect allies, the Fighter is the prototypical front line party member.

- **Bonus Damage**: Fighters gain a bonus to all damage rolls based on their Strength.
- **Warden:** When a Fighter [[Set Defense|Sets Defense]], they can designate an adjacent ally to protect. Until the next turn, the ally is granted a +2 AC.
- **Multiple Attacks:** Fighters gain an extra melee attack on every odd round at level 2. At level 4 they can attack twice every round.
  

### Save Bonus
Fighters have a +1 bonus on all saving throws except against those against magic and spells.

### Skills

- **Knock Knock:** Fighters roll with advantage on Open Door and any other STR-based checks.
