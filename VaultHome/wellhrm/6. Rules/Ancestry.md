Most of the Haven Isles is populated by humans, but they are certainly not alone. Dwarves, Elves, and Halflings are not uncommon, especially in certain areas. Many of the creatures considered monsters by most folk are also sentient, and may eventually be available for use by player characters.


## Humans
Humans are the default ancestry, and thus they receive no specific bonuses or penalties as do the other ancestries. Humans have the most class options of any ancestry.

Humans are a hardy breed, fighting vigorously to expand and guard their civilization in a dangerous world. Many perils lurk beyond the borders of the human lands, but humanity must be ever alert to the possibility of treachery within its own territories and kingdoms: The very individuality that makes humankind so diverse and energetic as a ancestry can also breed those who are dark of mind and willing to cooperate with the forces of evil and chaos.


## Dwarves

The Dwarf player character takes 25% more XP to level, but has the following traits:

**Innate Resistance - Magical:** Dwarven characters have +4 on saving throws against any magic.
**Stoner Heritage:** Dwarves easily take note of certain features of stonework: sloping corridors, moving walls, and traps made of stone â€” in particular, falling blocks, rigged ceilings, and tiny arrow slits designed to release poison gas or darts. They can also identify whether stonework is recent or not. Dwarves have a **1/6 chance** to recognize these features even when not actively searching and roll with advantage when they are.
**Darkvision:** Dwarves can see in the dark to a limit of 60 feet.

## Elves
The Elf player character takes 20% more XP to level, but has the following traits:

**Spatial Awareness:** Much like Dwarves with stonework, Elves have a **1/6 chance to recognize secret doors and passageways** even when not actively searching and roll with advantage when they are.
**Innate Immunity - Paralysis:** There is something that's hard to pin down about Elves. Elves cannot be paralyzed.
**Darkvision:** Elvenkind can see in the dark to a limit of 60 feet.

  

## Halflings

The Halfling player character takes 15% more XP to level, but has the following traits:

**Lucky:** Once a day, Halflings can re-roll a failed save. Lucky little bastards.
**Good Eye:** Halflings gain a +1 to-hit bonus when using missile weapons.
