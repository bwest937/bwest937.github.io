## Detection
MU can make Learn Spell/Languages check to detect a touched magical item. Some items will hide. Detect magic will work more reliably.

## Properties
Items that aren't hiding, if equipped/messed with, characters can make Int save to learn something about special qualities. Otherwise, a week of downtime + messing around and/or research will reveal most properties of most things.
