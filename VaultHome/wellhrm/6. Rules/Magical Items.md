## Magical Items

### Detection
A [[Magic User]] can roll on  [[Intelligence#Table A2 Intelligence Percentile|Table A2]] to detect that a touched item is magic in nature, but they don't get any information about it. Some magical items will hide, lie, or be actively disguised. Detect magic will work more reliably and helps avoid accidentally touching cursed items.

### Identification

- If a character equips or otherwise spends a turn messing with a magical item, they can roll on [[Intelligence#Table A2 Intelligence Percentile|Table A2]] to learn *something* about its special qualities. 
- Sages or other folks who can identify magical items for a price are rare in rural areas, but do exist.
- A week of downtime for character that includes messing with the item will identify most items.
