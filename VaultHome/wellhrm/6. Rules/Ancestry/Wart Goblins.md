### Hook Nosed Wart Goblins

#### Description
These goblins run to about four feet tall, and nearly as wide. Long, agile fingers and tail contrast with an ungainly teardrop-shaped body. They have a nose that nearly doubles the size of their head. Hook-nosed Wart Goblins are bright orangey-red with darker wart-like growths covering their bodies. 

**Height:** 4 feet 
**Weight:** 120–150 lbs 
**Lifespan:** 50–60 years  

They can be found throughout the countryside, living around farming villages and hamlets. They avoid both the larger towns and true wilderness.

Hook-nosed Wart Goblins are industrious workers and ignore both diurnal and seasonal cycles when they have a task to complete. Many have been known to even ignore food and sleep unless told to take breaks, working until they keel over. While rarely without a goal in mind, an idle Hook-nosed Wart Goblin just stands stoutly on its feet, moving its head from side to side to better take in the world’s scents.

### Traits
A Wart Goblin player character takes *20% more XP* to level and has the following traits:

**Natural Armor:** Wart Goblins **cannot wear armor** but have a natural AC of 13 that is modified by Dexterity **and** Constitution.
**Wartsmell:** Wart Goblins are surprised on a 1-in-8.
**Slow Metabolism:** Wart Goblins can go without food or sleep for a number of days equal to their Level without any penalty. For each successful saving throw, they can go an additional 12 hours. At the end of this time, for every day or partial day spent without sleep, they must rest for 8 consecutive hours (so after three days without sleep, the WG requires 24 consecutive hours of rest). If they don’t, they lose one point from each stat for each day or partial day spent awake until they get the rest. 
**Firmfoot:** A Wart Goblin has +2 on any roll against being dragged or knocked over.
