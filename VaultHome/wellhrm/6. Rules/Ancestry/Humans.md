### Humans
Humans are the default ancestry, and thus they receive no specific bonuses or penalties as do the other ancestries. Humans have the most class options of any ancestry.

Humans are a hardy breed, fighting vigorously to expand and guard their civilization in a dangerous world. Many perils lurk beyond the borders of the human lands, but humanity must be ever alert to the possibility of treachery within its own territories and kingdoms: The very individuality that makes humankind so diverse and energetic as a ancestry can also breed those who are dark of mind and willing to cooperate with the forces of evil and chaos.
