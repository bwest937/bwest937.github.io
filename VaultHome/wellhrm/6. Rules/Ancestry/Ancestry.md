## Playable Ancestries

Most of the Haven Isles is populated by humans, but they are certainly not alone. Dwarves, Elves, and Halflings are not uncommon, especially in certain areas. Many of the creatures considered monsters by most folk are also sentient, and may eventually be available for use by player characters.
