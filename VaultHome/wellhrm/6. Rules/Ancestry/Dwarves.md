### Dwarves

The Dwarf player character takes 25% more XP to level, but has the following traits:

**Innate Resistance - Magical:** Dwarven characters have +4 on saving throws against any magic.
**Stoner Heritage:** Dwarves easily take note of certain features of stonework: sloping corridors, moving walls, and traps made of stone â€” in particular, falling blocks, rigged ceilings, and tiny arrow slits designed to release poison gas or darts. They can also identify whether stonework is recent or not. Dwarves have a **1/6 chance** to recognize these features even when not actively searching and roll with advantage when they are.
**Darkvision:** Dwarves can see in the dark to a limit of 60 feet.
