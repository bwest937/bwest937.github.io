### Elves

The Elf player character takes *20% more XP* to level, but has the following traits:

**Spatial Awareness:** Much like Dwarves with stonework, Elves have a chance to recognize secret doors and passageways even when not actively searching and roll with advantage when they are.
**Innate Immunity - Paralysis:** There is something that's hard to pin down about Elves. Elves cannot be paralyzed.
**Darkvision:** Elvenkind can see in the dark to a limit of 60 feet.
