## Death and Dying

  

### Dropping to 0 HP

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections. When an ability score drops to 0, you die.

  
### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you take negative HP. If your negative HP is ever equal to your maximum HP, you are **no more**.


#### Example: One Dead Cleric

A cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 HP. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, with 12 damage remaining. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.


### Dying

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious and are Dying. Dying creatures cannot act, and if in combat or a dangerous situation, begin making Death Saving Throws instead.

### Death Saving Throws

When Dying, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life.

Roll a d20 and add (or subtract) your CON bonus. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. On your third success, you become **stable** (see below). On your third failure, you **die**.
  
Your success and failure counts are reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable. The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. Any healing will automatically stabilize a dying creature and bring them up to 0 HP. If the amount of HP healed was enough to bring them above 0, they are able to act.

**Rolling 1 or 20:** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

**Damage at 0 or negative HP:** If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you immediately suffer a death saving throw failure, as well as the damage.
 
**Stabilizing a Creature:**  A stable creature is no longer Dying, but it does remain unconscious. If it takes any damage, the creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again. A party member can stabilize a still-dying ally once out of combat.
