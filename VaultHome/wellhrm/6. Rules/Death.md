## Death and Dying

  

### Dropping to 0 HP

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections. When an ability score drops to 0, you die.

  
### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you take negative HP. If your negative HP is ever -10, you are **no more**. 

> [!example] 
> A [[Cleric]] with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 HP. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, with 12 damage remaining. Because the remaining damage is greater than 10, she dies immediately.


### Dying

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious and are Dying. Dying creatures cannot act, and if in combat or a dangerous situation, begin making death saving throws instead. Death saves continue until you are dead, alive, or stabilized.

#### Death Saving Throws

Roll a d20 and add (or subtract) your CON bonus. If the total is 10 or higher, you cling to life. If you fail, you have one more chance to avoid a long nap. On your second failure you **die*.*

**Rolling a 20:** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 20, you take [[System Shock]] and regain 1 hit point.

#### Healing
The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. Any magical healing will automatically stabilize a dying creature and bring them up to 0 HP. If the amount of HP healed was enough to bring them above 0, they take [[System Shock]] but are able to act.

#### Stabilizing
Once out of combat, the party can take a turn to stabilize a dying ally. The ally remains at 0HP and unconscious for 1d6 turns. When they awaken, they have 1HP and take [[System Shock]].

#### System Shock
Any PC who drops to 0HP and survives takes 1d6 - CON slots of [[System Shock]].
