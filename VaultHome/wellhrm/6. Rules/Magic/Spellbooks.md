## Spellbooks

### Description
Most spellbooks look pretty much how you expect, weighty tomes full of arcane symbols and literally unintelligible to anyone but their owner. They take up one inventory slot.

###  Care And Feeding
Some arcane casters see their spellbook as a menagerie of living entities that need tended every day, others simply acknowledge that the complexity of their known spells require constant review.

Regardless of their preferred metaphor, any character that uses a spellbook needs to spend an hour a day with it or risk mishaps when casting. If a spellbook-based caster goes for longer than their level number of days without spending time with their spellbook in quiet contemplation, their spells are subject to more and more Mishaps:

* On the first day, casting the highest level spells in your spellbook causes a roll on the Magical Mishap table every time they are cast

* On subsequent days, the next-highest level spells are affected by the potential for Mishaps

* The first day after your 1st Level spells are affected by Mishaps, you begin forgetting how to decode your own spellbook.... permanently. Number your known spells and roll whatever common die is closest to this number. You forget the spell indicated by the roll result. If you are reunited with your spellbook, the spell is still there, but you have to roll a d100 per Table A2: Intelligence as if learning a new spell. If you fail, you can attempt again after a week.
