Scrolls are one-time-use version of magic spells. They can be used by the appropriate classes, even if they are unidentified or a higher level spell than the caster would normally have access to. Alternatively, they can be saved and when in an appropriate and safe place, be used to attempt to [[Learn Spell From Scroll or Book|learn the spell permanently.]]

###  Identification

All casters automatically identify scrolls of spells they already know. Identification still takes a turn.

### Using Unidentified Scrolls

As long as the scroll is of a type of magic known by the caster, a scroll can be used without identifying it first. Obviously this is risky!

  
### Scribing Scrolls

Scrolls may be created by Clerics or Magic-users at a cost of 100 gold pieces per level of the spell, and require a week of work for each spell level.

### Protection Scrolls
This is a rare form of scroll that may be used by any adventurer.
