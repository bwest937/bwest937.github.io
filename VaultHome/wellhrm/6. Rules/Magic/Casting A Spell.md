### Casting A Spell

#### Magic Dice [MD]

Instead of spell slots, spells of all kinds are cast with Magic Dice [MD]. Casters get one d6 [MD] per level. When casting a spell, roll at least one [MD]. On a roll of 4-6, the [MD] is not expended and can be used again that day. Spells of a higher level don't cost any extra [MD], but they do add to your initiative (+1 for every level past 1). [MD] replenish when you get a Good Rest.

#### Additional [MD]
  
When casting a spell, decide how many of your available [MD] to put into the spell. Using additional [MD] can increase the effect of the spell and make it more likely an important spell is actually cast.
  
#### Combat

##### Concentration

If a spellcaster takes damage while casting, or when trying to maintain certain spell effects, they have to check [[Concentration]].

![[Concentration|clean]]

* If you fail and have multiple [MD] in the spell, you can burn one of the additional [MD] to continue casting the spell. The burned [MD] is lost for the day. This can be done multiple times, but there must always be at least one [MD] available or the spell is lost.

* If you fail a Concentration skill check and only have one [MD], you lose the [MD] for the day and the spell is interrupted.

##### Declaration
During combat, spells must be declared before Initiative is rolled. A spellcaster *cannot be in melee* when they declare their spell, and they can't move or do anything else on their turn when casting.

**Exception**: A caster may decide to ready a spell **before** combat breaks out, in which case the spell can be cast on their turn without declaring and they get their normal actions (including deciding to cast another spell). This is risky since any damage or anything else that might break [[Concentration]] risks losing [MD] before combat even starts.
