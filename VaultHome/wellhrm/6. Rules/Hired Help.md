### Hirelings/Porters/Torchbearers/Guides

The folks are hired help that will accompany the party on adventures, but will usually not fight. They can be used for guard duty, but will probably cower/run/die if combat breaks out. Their preferred position is wherever is safest. They will refuse to do anything overtly risky, but can be coaxed to do moderately risky things with a Loyalty check and/or more GP.

They usually cost 10 GP/week and unless otherwise specified, they have [[Normal Person]] stats.

  
### Retainers

Retainers are capable folk for hire. They will have a level and class, like PCs. Potential retainers may be located by frequenting drinking establishments or by paying to post notices of help wanted. PCs usually need to be at least level 2 to hire retainers, due to the lack of reputation of level 1 characters.

  **Wages:** Retainers will usually want a guaranteed fee (per day or per adventure) **and** a share of treasure recovered (at very least a half share). For example: a fee of 10gp per day plus a half share of treasure. Generous offers may increase the loyalty of the retainer.

**Shares of Treasure:** Fractional shares of treasure are calculated by dividing the treasure by the total number of shares.

  
> [!example] Example: Treasure Shares
> A party consisting of 5 PCs (who receive full shares) plus one retainer (who is paid a half share) discover 2,750gp of treasure. The total is divided by 5.5 (five full shares plus one half share): 500gp. Thus, each PC gains 500gp and the retainer gains 250gp.


### Recruitment
If the players want to recruit a retainer to work for the company, they can check local gathering and drinking places, or consider posting help wanted notices. They may run into capable NPCs and want to make an offer on the spot. Regardless, one PC is designated to negotiate terms. A PC can only have as many retainers as their [[Charisma]] allows.

  
### Loyalty
Determined when the help is hired based on Table A3, plus any situational adjustments.

### Loyalty Check

To make a loyalty check, the DM rolls 2d6 against the hireling's loyalty. If the roll is lower than or equal to the retainerâ€™s loyalty, the check succeeds.

  
### Promotion

A hireling that survives a long time or a particularly crazy situation might gain 1 XP and become a level 1 character, at which time employment terms will need to be revisited.

If the party wishes to make a retainer a permanent member of the party, we will let the situation and roleplaying guide the outcome, however there is certain to be some sort of signing bonus (GP leaves the game). The retainer would become an active party member like any other.
