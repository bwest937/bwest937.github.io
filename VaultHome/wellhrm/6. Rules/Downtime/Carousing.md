*Once* per session while in a civilized settlement, a PC may choose to Carouse in order to gain extra experience points. A PC who goes carousing must choose to spend a certain amount of GP, limited by the size of the settlement (they can always choose to carouse at a lower level). The result determines how much they actually spend, and how much XP they gain.

- If the amount of gold spent is more than the PC has on hand, they owe the money to someone (probably nefarious) or must borrow it from other PCs. 
- If the die roll is higher than the carouserâ€™s level (automatic at level 1), they still gain the listed XP, but must roll on the Carousing Mishaps table.
