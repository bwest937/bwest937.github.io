Once per session while in a civilized settlement, a PC may choose to donate to philanthropic causes in order to gain extra experience points. A PC who participates in Philanthropy must choose to spend a minimum amount of GP, determined by the size of the settlement. In return, they receive **70%** of the GP expended in XP.

### Item Donation

If approved by the GM, PCs may also donate items directly to a local institution. The institution must actually want and be able to make use of the donation, this is not an opportunity to get rid of hard-to-sell junk. A PC with a specific attachment to the institution (for example, a cleric donating looted relics to the church) may get a higher % of the items value in XP.
