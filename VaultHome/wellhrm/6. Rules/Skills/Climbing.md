## Climbing

**Anytime you need to travel up or down at an angle sharper than you can walk, it’s climbing.** You climb to hike mountain paths, to scale fortress walls, to shimmy up cavern ceilings, and to hang off the undersides of great beasts. It’s dangerous, like all good things.

 
### Pace
Climbing allows for three paces: normal, half, creep. Slower has better odds of success.

### Angles of Ascent

**Slope 30°–80°:** Less than 30° doesn’t need a climbing roll.

**Wall 81°–100°:** Straight vertical, or close enough.

**Overhang 101°–170°:** Like climbing the inside of an arch.

**Ceiling 171°–190°:** More than 190° is an ass-over-head overhang.

### Climbing Roll
Choose a pace, and up your modifiers. If you are at 6 or more, you automatically succeed. Otherwise, roll 1d6 + STR and compare to the table below.

#### Chance of Success
| **Pace** | **Slope** | **Wall** | **Overhang** | **Ceiling** | 
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Creep    | 7-in-6    | 4-in-6   | 3-in-6       | 1-in-6     |
| Half     | 6-in-6    | 3-in-6   | 2-in-6       | 0-in-6     |
| Full     | 5-in-6    | 2-in-6   | 0-in-6       | -2-in-6    |


#### ADD 1-IN-6 IF:

- You have a rope-line or handholds.
- You are being actively helped by someone else. This, too, can stack if multiple people help you.
- You have an opposing wall to brace yourself against.


#### SUBTRACT 1-IN-6 IF:

- You are wearing heavy armor.
- You have a pack on your back.
- You have something in your hand, like a sword or torch. This can stack if both hands are occupied.
- You are in darkness or otherwise cannot see the whole route.
- You are very large.
- The passage is underwater, filled with rubble, or otherwise is impeded.

### Failure
If you fail your climbing roll, make a STR Save. If you fail, roll on this table for the consequences:


| Roll | Consequence                                                                                                     |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | You slip! If on a slope or have rope, slide down 1d6 × 10’. If not, make another STR save or [[Falling\|Fall!]] |
| 2    | Your gear scrapes against the passage. You lose 1 randomly determined piece of gear.                            |
| 3    | You make a wrong move somewhere and have to twist around to fix it. Reverse your head-feet-first direction.     |
| 4    | [[Falling\|Fall!]]                                                                                              |
