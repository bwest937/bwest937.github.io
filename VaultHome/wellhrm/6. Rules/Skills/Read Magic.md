> **Read Magic:** Â As versatile students of all magic, Magic-Users can identify almost any scroll or magical writing, even if not of arcane origin. To identify a scroll or otherwise read magical writing, a Magic-User rolls d100 per [[Intelligence#Table A2]]. This takes a turn if in a dangerous environment. In case of failure, the Magic-User needs a good rest before the confusion of the unknown system of magic clears and another attempt can be made.
