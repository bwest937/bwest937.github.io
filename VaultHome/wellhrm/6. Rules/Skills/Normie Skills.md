## Character Skills

In general, characters can just do anything they reasonably ought to know how to do. Skill checks are only to be used when there are meaningful consequences for failure, time pressure, or both. These are 1d6 rolls, +/- a stat bonus, if any. Certain classes and races may be better or worse.

### Open Door

> [!summary] Open Doors
>1d6 + STR, base chance 1/6

Stuck doors (and many doors in an ancient dungeon are stuck) requires a Strength skill check to force open. Â It is important to get the door open on the first try, because a failed attempt warns any monsters on the other side of the door that there is trouble.

**Multiple characters:** Up to a maximum of three characters can attempt to smash through a door together, giving each one a separate, normal chance of success all at once. However, they spill into the room and will be surprised if there are monsters within.

**Pickle Jar:** If a Open Door check fails and the door remains stuck, the next attempt gets a +2 "I loosened it for you" bonus.

> [!example]
> A character with +1 STR is trying to force open a stuck door. They roll a 2, and add 1 for a total of 3. They needed a 6 (1/6 chance) so the door remains stuck but now has a 2/6 chance on the next attempt.

  

### Listen At Door/Hear Noise

> [!summary] Hear Noise
>1d6 + WIS, base chance 1/6


This skill represents concentrating for a turn and trying to hearing faint sounds. This skill is **not** required to hear the sound of combat or normal talking in the next room over. The DM will roll this Wisdom skill check. If the character doesn't hear anything, they won't know for sure if they failed or if there was nothing to hear.

### Search For Room Traps/Secret Doors
> [!summary] Search Traps/Doors
>1d6 + WIS, base chance 2/6
  
When characters want to spend a turn search an area for traps, pits, secret doors, or other hidden features, the DM will roll this Wisdom skill check. If the character doesn't find anything, they won't know for sure if they failed or if there was nothing to find.

  


* Finding a trap does not necessarily mean the characters know how to disarm it, although in some cases it may be obvious.
* Finding a secret door does not necessarily mean the characters know how to open it; they just know that it is there.
