This skill represents concentrating for a turn and trying to hearing faint sounds. This skill is **not** required to hear the sound of combat or normal talking in the next room over. The DM will roll this Wisdom skill check. If the character doesn't hear anything, they won't know for sure if they failed or if there was nothing to hear.
