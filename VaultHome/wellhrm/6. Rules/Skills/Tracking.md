## Tracking

Tracking success is checked with a roll on a d100/percentile die.

**Outdoor Tracking:** Outdoors, the basic chance for successful tracking is 90%, modified by a â€“10% for each day old the tracks are. Rain, snow, or anything else that makes tracking more difficult reduces the chance by 10%.


**Underground and City Tracking:** Tracking in the city (any urban or populated area) or underground, makes it considerably harder to find and follow a trail. First, the beginning of the trail must be no more than an hour/level old. The base chance to track is still 90%, but each time the trail changes, there is a chance (25%, plus 25% for elevation changes, hiding their tracks, etc.) to lose the trail and be unable to track it further.
