>When attempting to learn a new spell from an scroll, spellbook or other written source, roll a d100 per [[Ability Scores#Table A2 Intelligence]]. If learning from a scroll is unsuccessful, the scroll is consumed and no more attempts can be made. Spellbooks and other sources *may* allow more attempts or have other unique rules.
