> 
> **Silent environments:** Moving silently is required to sneak unnoticed in a completely silent environment. e.g. if a guard is standing quietly listening for intruders, a roll to move silently may be required. 
> **Noisy environments:** Thieves can sneak unnoticed without a roll in environments with background noise (i.e. where moving absolutely silently is unnecessary). This includes combat. 
> **Failed rolls:** A thief who fails their roll to move silently is still assumed to be moving quietly, thus the normal surprise rules apply). 

## Elves
The Elf player character takes 20% more XP to level, but has the following traits:

**Spatial Awareness:** Much like Dwarves with stonework, Elves have a **1/6 chance to recognize secret doors and passageways** even when not actively searching and roll with advantage when they are.
**Innate Immunity - Paralysis:** There is something that's hard to pin down about Elves. Elves cannot be paralyzed.
**Darkvision:** Elvenkind can see in the dark to a limit of 60 feet.
