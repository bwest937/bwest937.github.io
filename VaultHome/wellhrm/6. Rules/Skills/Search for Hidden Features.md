### Search for Hidden Features
> [!skill] Search for Hidden Features
>**Roll:** 1d6 + `=this.ability`
>**Base Chance:** `=this.base`

>When characters want to spend a turn search an area for traps, pits, secret doors, or other hidden features, the DM will roll this Wisdom skill check. If the character doesn't find anything, they won't know for sure if they failed or if there was nothing to find.
>- Finding a trap does not necessarily mean the characters know how to disarm it, although in some cases it may be obvious.
>- Finding a secret door does not necessarily mean the characters know how to open it; they just know that it is there.
