### 1. Roll Ability Scores

Choose one of the following methods for score generation:
  
#### Old School
The old-school method is "3d6 down-the-line": roll 3d6 for each stat in order and then you choose your class based on the results. It can make for a great story when your super weak Cleric saves the day time and time again and eventually outlives everyone else to ascend into sainthood.

A character rolled in this method will be granted a not-very-old-school 5% XP bonus, and the DM will be honor-bound to recognize your bold choice forever more... or at least as long as the character lasts.

#### Guidance Counselor
Roll 3d6 for each stat and apply the rolls to the stats however you choose. This should make playing a specific class much easier. If none of your abilities have a 16 or higher, replace one of your scores with a 16.

  
### 2. Choose an [[Ancestry]]


### 3. Choose a [[Class]]

There is probably a custom character sheet for your class on the share drive, but don't feel obligated to use it.

  
### 4. Note Ability Modifiers

You should have enough information to start filling out the character sheet now. Start by marking down your ability modifiers.

  
### 5. Note Saving Throw and HP

Note your saving throw and any modifiers. Base save comes from your class, but ancestry may add some modifers.

  

### 6. Note your Max HP

Starting HP is a max roll on your HD size, +/- your CON bonus.



### 7. Choose Alignment

Choose Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic and make a note of it. Certain classes may have alignment restrictions.

  
### 8. Buy Equipment

Use [[Quick Equipment]] or spend 3d6 x10 gp on equipment.

### 9. Note Armor Class

Your unarmored AC is 10. Add the bonus from any armor you purchased, plus your DEX bonus.


### 10. Note XP Factor

High score in Wisdom and prime abilities (see [[Ability Scores]]) make you level up quicker, while demihuman ancestries slow your progression. The DM can help with this part.

  
### 11. Note Starting and Target XP

Your starting XP is your Campaign XP (or 0 if you don't have any). Your target for your next level is per your class advancement table, multiplied by your XP factor. Again, the DM can help with this part. Note your target XP for your next level.
