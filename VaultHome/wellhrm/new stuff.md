# Spellcasting
## method 1
by the S&W book, but with roll to cast like shadowdark (d20 + stat), The DC to successfully cast a spell is 10 + the spell’s tier.
fail = mishap, lose spell
## method 2
by the S&W book, but 
 - with roll to cast like shadowdark (d20 + stat), The DC to successfully cast a spell is 10 + the spell’s tier.
 - with spells = level
fail = mishap, lose spell
keep = DC + tier + 4 (lvl1 = 15)
## mishaps
shadowdark has some good ones, but could trim that down, and then add the existing book as an entry on that table

## Karameikos
cut out foamfire, attach newly open trail to lost valley more or less directly north of threshold
    - lizards (or Varactyls) to transport in and out (rented, expensive)
in the valley:
    
- lots of undead in most above ground places, and some below of course
- gnolls, maybe orcs or goblins around
- fauna
    - get some weird shit in there
- some kind of megadungeon, but places to explore around of course
    - factions?
    - humans, working with the new commerce, but weird
        - some caretakers
    - tower in lake/place of lake.. maybe a wizard hutakka SUMMONED the beastly horde, on accident
        - or maybe he found out they were the "Servitor race" after all

    - "Slanting (or sloping) passages, space distortion areas, and teleporters are meant to confuse or strand the party. They foul maps, take the group to areas they do not wish to enter, and so on. The same is true of sinking/rising (elevator) rooms, sliding rooms, and chutes. As an example of the latter, consider a chute at the bottom of a pit, or one at the end of a corridor which slopes upwards-so that the effect is to deposit the party on the original level but seemingly on one deeper."
- size
    - if you make hexes 1 mile.. 15x9ish https://www.themeasureofthings.com/results.php?comp=area&unit=mi2&amt=90
