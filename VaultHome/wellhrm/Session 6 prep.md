- mention other classes. totally not needed but i have class brain, so im thinking about these, but if any one is feeling some gaps lmk
    - witchfinder
    - demon hunter
    - monk/kineticsit
    - binder/warlock

##### dc encounter prep
i think remove the baddies and track them on graph paper, but also can use a black circle for visual indicator

#### before the dungeon
- [[Kog]] picked up some chatter in the inn:
    - Griffon complaints remain, [[Gallos, Innkeeper]] is worried his cheese supply might be affected
    - An uptick in "coalhead" activity. there is always some of that associated with hosting the market, but some locals have been spotted consorting with coalhead goblins (believed to hang out at the temple)
- shopping (hammer/spikes, [[Antidote]], oil, etc)
    - mention [[Dragon Shit Sword]]
    - mention the +2 mace, other gear swaps
    - mention hirelings 
- they pass [[Felona Veldane]], who notes they look they are ready to get something done, but doesn't pry.

#### Whats going on back in the dungeon
- DCs discussing next move, they carry a token of a silver hand and have a vague notion they can seek help from them
- realize someone was in the dungeon and they may have limited time
- 3 begin digging in the furniture room, one is guarding centipede room and will cast dark and they will run south if they detect the party
    -  they accessed via the propped door, still scared of the secret door
    - but let the 1-way door close so they can't be sneaked on
    - 4 and treasure still in power room
