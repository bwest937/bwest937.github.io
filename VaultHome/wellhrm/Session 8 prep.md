(stuff they know about but arent engaging with)

- [[Kog]] picked up some chatter in the inn:
    - Griffon complaints remain, [[Gallos, Innkeeper]] is worried his cheese supply might be affected
    - An uptick in "coalhead" activity. there is always some of that associated with hosting the market, but some locals have been spotted consorting with coalhead goblins (believed to hang out at the temple)

#### before the dungeon
- Clearing the dungeon is going to be one of Quinn's conditions, so make sure they are prepared to explore, clean up inventory, etc


#### Quinns take
Having rested, he is begging to understand some advantages - he wants to study their dark magic and magic crystal prowess
Issues 


- access: quinn and party in, darkfolk out
    - what are the rules, what is the physical how
    -  my ideas
        - quin might want a doo
        -  probably going to need second tunnel out , esp if the party wants access occassionally
            - df can do this, could make it quite nice and come up in a spot chosen in concert with qui. 
- provisions, water, food
    - quinn can help some here
    - but ultimately they are going to want autononmy, especially the miners

- costs
    - to leverage dagger making, tinkering, etc, they can use quinns aupplies to an extent but will probably need their own tools at some point
    - food, wall repair, tools for tunneling etc should require a couple hundred gold
