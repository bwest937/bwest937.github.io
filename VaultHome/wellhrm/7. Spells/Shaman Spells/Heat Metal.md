**Class:** [[Highland Shaman]]
**Spell Level:** `=this.spell_level`  
**Range:**  30 ft
**Duration:**  7 rounds
**Tags:** #shaman_basic 

This spell heats metal to searing hot temperatures, affecting 20 pounds of metal per level of the caster. As a rule of thumb, this magic affects the armor and weapons of one opponent per caster level when used as a general attack, although the spell is definitely not limited to general combat. Metal does not get a saving throw against being heated, but any sort of magical fire resistance prevents damage from the heat itself.

- Round 1: The metal becomes hot, but is not yet dangerous. 
- Round 2: 1d4 points of damage. If hands are what remain in contact, the blistering makes them unusable for 1 day thereafter. 
- Rounds 3–5: 1d4+1 points of damage per round. If hands remain in contact, their skin is so badly scorched that they cannot be used for 1d3 weeks. If the head is in contact, the victim falls unconscious for 1d8 turns. 
- Round 6: 1d4 points of damage. 
- Round 7: The metal has begun to cool, and is merely hot to the touch
