This spell illuminates an object or creature with an eerie, fey glow. The spell’s target may be approximately as large as 10 square feet plus 2 square feet per level of the caster. The spell can be used for diverse purposes, such as revealing the true dimensions or extent of a thing, or to prevent a creature from retreating into the darkness. Usually such illumination renders a creature more easily hit, granting a +1 to-hit bonus to attackers.
