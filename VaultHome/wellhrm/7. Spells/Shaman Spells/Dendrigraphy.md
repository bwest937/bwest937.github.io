Allows you to ask question per [[Number MD]] of a tree that you touch. Answer appears in letters on the trunk. Trees are fairly intelligent. They know about weather and have a great sense of time, but they have a hard time differentiating between animals, except by size. They also gossip among themselves, and may have gossip from distant lands.
