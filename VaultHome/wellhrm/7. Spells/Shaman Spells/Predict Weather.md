The Shaman silently drinks in knowledge from the surrounding area, becoming attuned to the patterns of air, wind, earth and fire. Within moments, the character
can predict what the weather conditions will be for the next 12 hours in the immediate vicinity (2 square miles per [[MD]]). As with most forecasts of weather, conditions may change unexpectedly, giving rise to a 5% chance that the Shaman's prediction will, ultimately, prove to be incorrect.
