#### Barksin

___

- **Spell Level:** Shaman, 2nd Level

- **Range:** Touch

- **Duration:** [sum MD] rounds

___

The barkskin spell magically toughens a creature’s skin, making it as strong as tree bark. The recipient of the spell improves his or her armour class by one point and also gains a +1 bonus on all saving throws.

  
  

#### Chant

___

- **Spell Level:** Cleric, 2nd Level

- **Range:** 30 ft radius centered on caster

- **Duration:** Concentration

- **Quick:** If cast with 2 [MD], can be cast immediately during the Declare Spells phase of combat.

___

Once the spell is cast, the cleric must maintain a sonorous

chanting of holy words and prayers, which not only lend

divine favor to the cleric and his or her allies but also bring

disfavor to their foes. For so long as the cleric continues to chant, his or her allies (within the

area of effect) gain a bonus of +1 to all attack rolls, damage

rolls, and saving throws. Enemies within the spell’s area

of effect also suffer a –1 to all such die rolls. If the cleric

breaks concentration, the effect of the spell will end. Moving quicker than half-speed or being silenced automatically breaks concentration.
