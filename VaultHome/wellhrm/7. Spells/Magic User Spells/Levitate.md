#### `=this.file.name`

**Class:** [[Magic User]]
**Spell Level:** `=this.spell_level`  
**Range:**  Self
**Duration:**  1 turn/caster level
**Tags:** `=this.tags`

This spell allows the Magic-User to levitate himself, moving vertically up or down, but provides no assistance with lateral movement. A wall, cliff side, or ceiling could, of course, be used to pull along hand-over-hand. Levitation allows up- or downward movement at a rate of up to 6 feet per minute (60 feet per turn), and the caster cannot levitate more than 20 feet per caster level (60ft at level 3) from the ground level where the spell was cast. (Such range is applied to movement into the air and to downward movement into a pit or chasm.)
