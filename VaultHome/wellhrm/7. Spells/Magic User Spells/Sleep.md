**Class:** [[Magic User]]
**Spell Level:** `=this.spell_level` 
**Range:** 240ft
**Duration:**  1 hr
**Tags:** `=this.tags`

This spell puts creatures around a targeted point into an enchanted slumber (no saving throw permitted). Causes creatures (except undead) to fall into a magical slumber. It affects creatures based on their hit dice, weakest creatures first.

| HD of Victim     | Number Affected   |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Less than 1 to 1 | 1d10 + [[MD Sum]] |
| 1+ to 2+         | 1d6 + [[MD Sum]]  |
| 3 to 3+          | [[MD Sum]]        |
| 4 to 4+          | 1 per [[MD]]      | 


A sleeping creature requires a full round to waken and must be shaken or slapped to bring it to consciousness; mere noise, however loud, will not disturb the enchanted slumber of a sleep spell’s victim.
