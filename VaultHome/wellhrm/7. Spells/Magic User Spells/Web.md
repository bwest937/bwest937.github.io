Fibrous, sticky webs fill [MD] x 10' cube(s) of area. No creature affected can cast spells or attack. It is extremely difficult to get through the mass of strands — it takes one turn if a torch or sword is used. 

The strands of a web spell are very flammable. If they are ignited, fire will burn through the entire web at a rate of 1 turn per 10' cube, dealing 2d4 points of damage to all creatures within and burning away the webs. 

The time to break free without blade or fire depends on size and strength. Some examples:

- Typical Medium Creature: 1d4+1 turns

- Magically-augmented Medium Creature, Most Large Creatures: 2 turns

- Giant-range Str, most Dragons: 2 rounds
