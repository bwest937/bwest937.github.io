#### `=this.file.name`

**Class:** [[Magic User]]
**Spell Level:** `=this.spell_level`  
**Range:**  Close
**Duration:**  Permanent until dispelled
**Tags:** #mu_basic 

As with a [[Hold Door]] spell, wizard lock holds a door closed, but it is permanent until dispelled. Creatures with magic resistance can shatter the spell without effort. 
Any [[Magic-User]] at least three levels higher than the caster can open the portal, and a knock spell will open it as well, although the spell is not permanently destroyed in these cases.
