A magical missile for every [[MD]] flies where the caster directs, with a range of 150 feet. The missile hits automatically, doing 1d4+1 points of damage.

For every odd-level (not counting 1st) of the caster, add a missile to the total. For example, a level 5 Magic-User would add 2 extra missiles.
