#### `=this.file.name`

**Class:** [[Magic User]]
**Spell Level:** `=this.spell_level`  
**Range:**  240 ft
**Duration:**  1 hr
**Tags:** #mu_basic 

The pyrotechnics spell requires an existing fire source (which may be anywhere in the spell’s range) and may be used to produce two different effects (players may propose other effects):

- **Fireworks:** On a failed save the flashing display will temporarily blind (for [[MD Sum]] rounds) all creatures in the area of effect and 120 ft beyond— provided that the display is not obstructed from view. The fireworks persist for at least 1 round/level.

- **Billowing Smoke:** If the spell is used to produce smoke, a billowing cloud will emanate from the fire source, obscuring vision beyond 20 ft. The DM decides exactly how much smoke is produced and if there are any other effects, but there will be at least 8000 cubic feet (roughly 20 x 20 x 20 feet). The smoke persists for at least [[MD Sum]] turns.
