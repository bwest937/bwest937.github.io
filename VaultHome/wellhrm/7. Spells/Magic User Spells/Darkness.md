#### Darkness
___
**Class:** [[Magic User]]
**Spell Level:** `=this.spell_level`
**Range:** 60 ft
**Duration:** 1 hour + 1 turn/level
**Tags:** `=this.tags`

This spell has three common usages:

1. **Conjuring dark:** Creates a 15ft radius area of magical blackness, preventing normal sight (but not infravision). If cast with 2+ [[MD]], the dark is darker than night and prevents infravision. The spell may be cast upon an object, in which case the dark moves with the object.

2. **Blinding a creature:** By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the target fails a saving throw, it is blinded for the duration. A blind creature attacks with disadvantage.

3. **Cancelling darkness:** Darkness may cancel a [[7. Spells/Magic User Spells/Light|Light]]  spell of equal [[MD]] , or reduce the effect of a [[7. Spells/Magic User Spells/Light|Light]]  spell cast with more [[MD]].
