### Tree treasure room. this might be better
1 Mosaic room Recently disturbed dust (the room has been thoroughly looted). A grand mosaic depicts a sylvan scene of grazing elk, blooming flowers, and fruit-laden trees. One figure appears out of place. He wears modern adventuring garb and an expression of pure horror (his hands are raised as if in warning). • Grand mosaic. If touched, the adventurer’s world changes instantly. The character’s flesh is now composed of stained glass, coloured stone, and ceramic tesserae. Reality has one less dimension than they recall. The PC’s only company is that of Nigel, a member of Belynda’s Bastards who made the same mistake (the rest of the party see their comrade appear in the mosaic). • Rescue: Mosaiced adventurers can be liberated with careful carving (roll a d20 under DEX) and a stone to flesh spell.
