# Session 10 Recap


**Friday, March 5th**
The Goodtime Gang escaped a petrification scroll, found the final resting place of an ancient cleric, and all around 100%ed the [[Undermill]]!  They traded two of their crystal skulls to Quinn for IDs on the Ring of Protection and Ring of Fire Resistance.

**Saturday, March 6th**
- Gertrude is doin' fine!
- Kevin scribed a scroll

**Saturday, March 7th**
##### Market Day!
Some potion fun, some useful gear acquisition, and most importantly, cart and mule secured!


### MVP
I totally forget!

### New Rumor
While shopping at the market, there was a lot of talk of increased bandit activity on the road outside Wellhrm

### Be Aware

### Next Up
I believe the plan is to do some outdoor adventuring and head towards the Cranky Coot Shack(TM) in hex A8
