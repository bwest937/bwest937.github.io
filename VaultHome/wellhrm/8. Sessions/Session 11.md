# Session 11 Recap


**Monday, March 9th**
The Git Gud kids head out towards the farthest possible landmark on the map. Some exploring and chill fishing and camping ensued. A tantalizingly close "campfire" led to a creepy sneaky encounter in the night. 

**Tuesday , March 10th**
In the morning, the hunters has no problem finding some tracks and tracking down the thing that tried to lure them to their death in the night, a Cindersham. They took some fire to the face but came out victorious with a fire-resistant pelt for their trouble. 

**It Is Tuesday March 10, 10am**

### MVP
I know it was Mason, so I think it was all about Barnaby's archery.


### Be Aware
- Undermill back entrance is now complete, the Darkfolk are available for crafting or whatever else. 
- Crystal Lantern ready tomorrow
- Barnaby has a sidearm (minor patch notes)

### Next Up
Verify whether they had the mule and cart, I believe not. Either way they had time to heal up after fight if they want.
