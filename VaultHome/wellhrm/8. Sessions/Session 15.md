# Session 15 Recap


**Monday March 15th**
After a day of rest, the All Goofus, No Gallants headed back to the shack. Ambushed by nasty Four-Eyed Grabbers, Gertrude got bit and almost bit it. The tense situation cost the party a day, but they arguably came out ahead, now rocking the carapaces of their defeated enemies as shields. 

##### Today is Tuesday March 16th
It's morning after some chill camping/resting

### MVP
Ooof I forget!

### Death Rule Change
Any PC who drops to 0HP and survives takes 1d6 - CON slots of System Shock

#### System Shock
When a character has one or more slots of System Shock they suffer the following penalties:
