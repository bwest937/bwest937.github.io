    - witchfinder
    - demon hunter
    - monk/kineticsit (already heard about htis)
    - binder/warlock

### current rumous
(stuff they know about but arent engaging with)

- [[Kog]] picked up some chatter in the inn:
    - Griffon complaints remain, [[Gallos, Innkeeper]] is worried his cheese supply might be affected
    - An uptick in "coalhead" activity. there is always some of that associated with hosting the market, but some locals have been spotted consorting with coalhead goblins (believed to hang out at the temple)

## before the dungeon
- Clearing the dungeon is going to be one of Quinn's conditions, so make sure they are prepared to explore, clean up inventory, etc
- related, the darkfolk asked the wtf they were leaving the dungeon the long way last time (connect C1 to entrance)


#### Quinns take
Having rested, he is begging to understand some advantages - he wants to 
- study their dark magic and magic crystal prowess
- have more room to train students
- they can help with the mill at night

Issues 
- access: quinn and party in, darkfolk out
    - what are the rules, what is the physical how
    -  my ideas
        - quin wants a door 
        -  probably going to need second tunnel out , esp if the party wants access occassionally
            - could make it quite nice and come up in a spot chosen in concert with quinn
            - 5 days if they use up the rest of the black powder to get through the bedrock amd hamd dig the rest
- provisions, water, food
    - quinn can help some here

- they are going to want autononmy, especially the miners
    - party (or a couple members) can take them out at night and show them around (property border, this is the road, this is the lake, etc)
        - 100 xp ea for the escort
        - (if this isnt done within a week, the miners will do something stupid)

- costs
    - to leverage dagger making, tinkering, etc, they can use quinns aupplies to an extent but will probably need their own tools at some point
        - 100 gp for a forge
    - 200gp for tools and timber for doors/tunnels
    - 100 gp for a forge
    - upkeep 50gp a month
   
   could use machine + black powder (expensive) to make a network of tunnels if they want lol
