# March 4-5


## Session 6 Recap
**Thursday, March 4th**
Violence was **mostly** avoided! There was some stabbing and poisoning but also some in-the-dark charming and 2 incredible hooves. A well-timed net from a very injured Alice ended the fight. There are some deals to be struck to keep everyone alive and out of jail or worse, the Witchfinder's torture chamber... but most importantly treasure was acquired and Alice is officially out first level 2 PC! Glornkus got un-cursed... again... and Frita healed up Strength damage from the poison.

**Thursday, March 5th**
When we pick up, the crew heads back to chaperone a meeting of Quinn and his new basement dwellers.

### MVP
Also went to Alice, so Mason really racked up the permanent XP!

### Be Aware
- Gertrude is resting up til *Saturday, March 6th* due to system shock
