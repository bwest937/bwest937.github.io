# Session 14 Recap

**Friday March 12**
The Loredumping Lorises had some tea with Rowan the scribe/book collector and learned some good stuff regarding the Silver Mine and the Wrenwalk mansion.

Kog the Partially Digested made a big impression with the locals at the Clumsy Fox, defeating Big Oggie in a game of Potato Juice, Potoato Juice! Gerit the innkeeper was... mildly less cranky after this. Big Oggie is an enemy for life. Perhaps more importantly, Kog established contact with Father George.

**Saturday March 13th**
Kevin, Barnaby, and Magnus led the Darkfolk rangers on a little expedition. They encountered a wise Great Owl, who granted them a boon for teaching them something truly new (that Darkfolk exist here). They chose to learn about the fate of Lord Wrenwalk, that he is a magic-casting undead known as a Zombrarie
