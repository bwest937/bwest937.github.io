# Session 12 Recap

**March 10**
The Griffon was encountered and... fed. The Looper bros were hired and the mule replaced. A nasty storm broke out as the Galloping Gogetems journeyed through the thick forest. After a not very restful night as the storm howled and poor looper bros slept under the cart, they had arrived.

**It is Wednesday, March 11 around 11am**
They explored the surrounding area and had a tense but ultimately peaceful encounter with some odd reptilian creatures. Additionally, they noticed an entrance/cave  in the mini-mountain looming above the shack.

### MVP
Mason sent Barnaby back to town with a quickness to re-mule and take home the MVP again.

### Be Aware
- Crystal Lantern is ready
- Hunters have sidearms!

### GM ToDo
Get Barnaby (Looper hire-er's) Cha to determine Looper's loyalty.

### Next Up
Coot Shack Ba-by
