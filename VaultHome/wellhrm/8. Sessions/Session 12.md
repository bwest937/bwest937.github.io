## GM ToDo
Get Barnaby (Looper hire-er's) Cha to determine Looper's loyalty.

# Session 12 Recap

**March 10**
Griffon encounter. Looper bros. Nasty storm. Made it to target, encounter reptilian creatures.

### MVP
Mason sent Barnaby back to town with a quickness to re-mule and take home the MVP again.


### Be Aware
- Crystal Lantern ready tomorrow
- Ben has a sidearm
