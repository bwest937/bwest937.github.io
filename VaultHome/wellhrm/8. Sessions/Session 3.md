# March 2
**Encounter check hours:** hours 3, 4, 7
**Bandits camped:** A4

## Posted Recap
A full friggin' house this week enacted the following shenanigans:

- Found a key on a dead guy
- Got away with only **Scronan** falling into an undetected pit trap
- Absolutely crushed some rather scary [[Centipede, Giant (Man-Sized)|Giant Centipedes]]
    - Alice kept a Centipede head for later in a cooking pot, which I thought was a rad move
    

### MVP

It was a close one between **Kevin** and **Frita**, but **Kevin** took it in the end due to good ol' combat competence.

### Next Week On

The gang has been in the dungeon for a full hour, but no sign yet of the weird dark guys. An unopended door beckons.

### Rules Note

We learned how I feel about shooting through multiple ranks of allies. That's been codified and published to [https://playergarden.vercel.app/](https://playergarden.vercel.app/ "https://playergarden.vercel.app/"), FWIW. I will continue to work on updating the player-facing rules there.
