# Session 13 Recap

**Thursday March 11**
The Gradual Goners carefully explored the shack and environs. Traps were avoided and clues obtained, but no trace of the coot himself. They decided to return to town to ask some questions and gear up. 

**It is Friday March 12, around 11am**
After camping out at the lakeshore spot in C3 and chowing down on some venison hunted up by Barnaby, they swung by their mill on the way back. Sharing their food and catching up on the [[darkfolk]] and mill happening, Barnaby agreed to take the ranger-y darkfolk on an excursion aboveground tonight (or the next?)

Town isn't at full bustle, but several caravans are already in town and things are definitely getting going. 

### MVP
Alice's trap avoidance won the day, Mason is really starting to separate from the pack on MVP takedowns!

### Be Aware
- Crystal Lantern is back in the party's hands and much less fragile now!
- Kevin has gained +1 to the dice chain on all cooking rolls

### Next Up
Visiting some town resources:
- leather worker for fire-resist armor (3 days)
- cooper for barrel if they want to wet brine on the go (10gp)
- [[Rowan Thompson]] the bookkeeper

### Patch Notes/GM Tings
- Players need to track non-consecutive downtime activities (like books)
- Does Trey have any magical research thoughts?
