# Session 17 Recap

##### Today is STILL Tuesday March 16th
It's been a lucky day so far! 

After some Looper shenanigans where somehow no one was injured, magic seeds were found. The Tantalizing Terrors traipsed back into the dungeon for a look around. The gang stumbled into some piercers and once again escaped untouched. Kog volunteered to squeeze past a boulder and get a big beautiful glimpse of a lovely treasure hoard... actively guarded by a White Dragon! They team hightailed it back down the tunnel, escaping once again!
