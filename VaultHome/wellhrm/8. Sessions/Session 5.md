# March 2 - 4
**Encounter check hours:** hours 3, 4, 7
**Bandits camped:** A4

## Posted Recap
**Something** turned out to be delicious-yet-deadly Tunnel Prawns! After a swingy fight that saw Gertrude dropped, the crew retreated to the furniture room and made some roasted some Prawns with herbs to heal up. Gertrude lost her last spell and they decided survival was the better part of valor and retreated from the dungeon. A jewel was sold, ale was drank, and everyone rested up.

### MVP

Barnaby the Hunter skewered two Prawns in as many rounds. 'twas dope, as the medieval fantasy pastiche kids say.

### Next Week On

- It will be *Thursday, March 4th*
- Gertrude is resting up til *Saturday, March 6th* due to system shock
- Roster adjustments will be decided on
- The Dragon Shit Sword is available. Thanks Glornkus!
