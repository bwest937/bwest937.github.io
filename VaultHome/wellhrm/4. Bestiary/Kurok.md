### Description
A kurok-spirit is a non-human spirit that manifests as a ghostly crocodile, limned with a transparent gray fire. Kuroks can **only be damaged by silver or magic weapons (or by spells)**. Anyone within melee attack range of the creature must make a saving throw or be paralyzed by the ghost-flames around the spirit’s crocodile body. When the kurok bites an opponent, the bite causes the temporary loss of 1d4 constitution points (recovered within 1d3 days); if a victim’s constitution drops to 0 as the result of a kurok’s bite, he dies and the spirit takes his soul to eat.

On death, the spirit leaves behind 1d4 teeth and nothing else.

### Abilities

**Paralyzing Aura:** Anyone within melee attack range of the creature must make a saving throw or be paralyzed by the ghost-flames around the spirit’s crocodile body.
