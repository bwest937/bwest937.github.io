Bandits are roving groups of thieves, some- times organized into small armies led by more powerful bandit chiefs and captains with higher hit dice. For every 30 bandits in such a group, there will be an additional 4th level fighter. For every 50 bandits, there will be an additional 5th level fighter. For every 100 bandits, there will be a fighter of 8th level. Bands of 200 or more have a 50% chance to be accompanied by a magic-user of 10th level, and a 50% chance to be accompanied by a (Chaotic) cleric of 8th level
