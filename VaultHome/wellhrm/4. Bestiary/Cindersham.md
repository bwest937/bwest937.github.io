## Description

**THEY ARE NOCTURNAL HUNTERS, ANGLERS OF THOSE LOST IN THE DARK**

The size of a **small campfire** or single torch, its light is **enticing**. The light connects to a long furred tail as a great feline creature with a wide froglike mouth. It hunches down in the shadows, the light gleaming off of its menacing eyes. . Blessed with the powers of **fire** they use their abilities to lure in the curious with their tails that emit a small steady flame. Capable of either ripping apart their prey with their vicious jaws or roasting them alive with gouts of cinders from deep in their bellies, they are a dangerous predator of the night.


### Notes
For Wellhrm, I like one of these luring as in the picture, but with more lurking in the dark. Hard to see the monster lurking just in the dark beyond... clock it at ~30 ft? Maybe an elf notices sooner. 

This monster teaches about breath weapons! Cone size, let's say 2ft -> 20 ft at widest.
