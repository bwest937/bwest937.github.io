### Description
Nasty creatures often described as “part dog and part fish,” dobarchú are actually more akin to dogs and otters than to fish, are **2-3 ft long** and range in color from dark brown to black. 

In fact, while swimming, this smaller variety of dobarchú are often **mistaken for standard otters**, but are far from it, having the strength and ferocity of a much larger animal, and with a speed and temperament comparable to wolverines. 

This variety of dobarchú has the same fondness for human flesh as the larger variety, and will attack them specifically for food (in deference to other races). They also will try to drown their prey to disable them, but their smaller size will sometimes prevent them from accomplishing the task, though their ferocity goes a long way.

### Abilities
10 morale vs Humans!

### Social
Alignment: `=this.alignment`
Number Encountered:  `=this.encountered`
% in Lair: `=this.lair`%

 If the lesser dobarchú are encountered in their lair, there will usually be 3-6 lesser dobarchú there (2 adults, and 1-4 pups/ young which are 40-60% grown). If a human intruder is present, all will attack. If no human intruder is present, only the adults will attack, but the young will defend themselves
