 Blink dogs are pack hunters, intelligent and usually friendly to those who are not of evil intent. They can #teleport short distances (without error) and attack in the same turn â€” in most cases (75%), a blink dog is able to #teleport behind an opponent and attack from the rear, with appropriate bonuses
