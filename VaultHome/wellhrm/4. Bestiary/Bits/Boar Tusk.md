> These are the tusks of a wild boar killed in battle. They can be crushed and ground into powder. Four tusks worth of this powder can be brewed into a stew or soup and consumed. Whoever consumes this stew or soup gains the ability to stay conscious and functional all the way down to -9 hit points. This will last for 3d6 hours. If you are at negative hit points when the effect expires, you will fall unconscious immediately. If you ever drop to -10 hit points, you will die regardless of whether or not you have consumed the stew.
