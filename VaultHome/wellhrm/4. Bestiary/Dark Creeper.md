### Description
Dark creepers are humanoids that stand just under 4 feet tall, always swathed in heavy, dark cloaks and wrappings. Their flesh is pale and moist, and their eyes are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul stench of sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily to the fact that they never take off their clothing—instead piling on new layers when the outermost one grows too ragged. Dark creepers lurk in the black places deep below the surface of the world, venturing forth at night or into neighboring societies when the urge to steal and cause mayhem grows too great to resist. Endless layers of filthy, moldering black cloth shroud these small creatures, leading some to believe that the creature inside is smaller still. Usually encountered in groups, dark creepers **flee from bright light**, but are quite brave in the darkness.

 Dark creepers use daggers in combat, coating them with the poison called *black smear*. Once they hit, the poison is consumed.
 
 Dark creepers (and dark stalkers) are able to employ magic to create a very deep darkness, much more potent than ordinary darkness/ light spells.  
 
 When a dark creeper is slain, its body combusts in a flash of bright white light, leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. All creatures within a 10-foot burst must make a saving throw or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. Other dark creepers within 10 feet are automatically blinded for at least 1 round.

### Abilities
**Black Smear  Poison:** On dagger hit, save or reduces the victim’s strength by 1d2 points per round for 2d6-1 rounds. If the victim’s strength is reduced to 0, the victim dies. If the victim survives, the points of strength will return in 1d6 hours. The poison on a blade is used up when the weapon hits.

**Special Dark:** (Treat as 1/day SLA). This deeper darkness has a radius of 1 frisbee, and several effects: 
1.  all normal light sources in the radius of effect are not only extinguished, but cannot be relit for a period of one hour
2.  all magical light sources must make a saving throw or be extinguished for a period of one hours
3.  darkvision will not penetrate the 50ft radius area around the object upon which the deeper darkness has been cast. Magical light sources that are not extinguished by the spell are able to function within the deeper darkness, but convey a range of vision no greater than 30ft.

**Lv 4 Thief Skills:**

For all the mayhem and trouble a pack of dark creepers can cause, this is nothing compared to the dangers a tribe led by the taller, even more sinister dark stalkers represents. Dark creepers treat their tall, lithe masters almost like gods, presenting them with offerings and obeying their every whim. Invariably, several dark stalkers serve as leaders to dark creeper tribes, with all of the tribe’s heavy work and labor falling on the diminutive shoulders of the creepers, freeing the dark stalkers for their own decadent pleasures. Yet the dark creepers themselves see no inherent imbalance in this arrangement—to a dark creeper, a life in the servitude of a dark stalker is a life fulfilled.
