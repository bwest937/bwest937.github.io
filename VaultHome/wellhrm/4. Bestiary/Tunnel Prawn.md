### Description
Tunnel prawns are scavengers resembling very large lobsters, with a hard, rocklike shell. These creatures wander through subterranean caverns eating bugs and fungi from the wall, floor, and ceiling. A tunnel prawn can scale walls and move along ceilings with no more difficulty than walking along a floor. These dungeon vermin are easily antagonized, and will attack any living beings venturing near. One tunnel prawn can provide the equivalent of a dayâ€™s rations. The meat is tough and very chewy, and keeps for only one day, but is actually quite delicious. Some taverns, usually those located near dungeon entrances, serve tunnel prawn as an item on the bill of fare, and will pay up to 3 gps for a fresh tunnel prawn. The prawns weigh about 20 lbs each.

### Abilities
**Climbing:** A tunnel prawn can scale walls and move along ceilings with no more difficulty than walking along a floor.
