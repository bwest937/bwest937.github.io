### Description
Giant rats are often found in dungeons, and are about the size of a cat, or perhaps a lynx. The bite of some (1-in-20) giant rats causes disease. A saving throw is allowed (versus poison). The effects of the disease are decided by the Referee.

### Grouping
Every 2 = +1 to hit, 2HP = lose 1 rat

### Abilities
**Rat Disease:** On bite, roll d20. On a 20, target must save versus poison or become diseased. Limb is (1d4) is infected. Lose use of it on the next day. If not treated in 3 days, amputate or die. Can be treated by herbalist (2 day recovery) or Cure Disease.
