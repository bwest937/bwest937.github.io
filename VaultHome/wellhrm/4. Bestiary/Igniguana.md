### Description
Igniguanas are large lizards about six feet long, with reddish hide and glowing eyes. They may be of some sort of elemental origin, coupling attributes of fire and earth, for they crawl directly through solid rock without digging, leaving no tunnel behind to mark their passage. They breathe small but intense blasts of fire, in a cone extending 20ft to a width of 20ft. Anyone within the cone takes 2d6 hit points of damage (save for half)

### Abilities
**Breathe Fire:** Once per encounter (or hour), breathe small but intense blasts of fire, in a cone extending 20ft to a width of 20ft. Anyone within the cone takes 2d6 hit points of damage (save for half)
