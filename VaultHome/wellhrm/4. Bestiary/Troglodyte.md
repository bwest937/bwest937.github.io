### Description

### Abilities
**Stench** In battle they emit a horrible smell that weakens most other species. Failing a save causes loss of one point of STR per round for 1d6 rounds, with the loss persisting for another 10 rounds thereafter.

**Chameleon Skin:** Their skin is slightly chameleon like, and they make good ambushers (surprise on 1-3).
