### Description

*FAT SQUAT INSECT THE SIZE OF A WATER PAIL DANGLES FROM A TREE BRANCH*. Its carapace is a dark shell of cast iron with eight segmented limbs like interlocking armor. Its head is dotted with a pair of beady eyes and a jaw of glistening fangs. A jagged spear juts in and out of its mouth in grisly anticipation. 

*DRAGON TICKS ARE MONSTROUS PARASITES-TURNED-PREDATOR.* Originally a form of lice only found on dragons, they are an invasive species that finds soft and easy prey in its new home. Their adamantine teeth, used for piercing dragon scale, easily sink into even the heaviest armor. 

*A DRAGON TICK WILL HIDE IN THE CANOPY OF A TREE*, sensing the air for a target before falling on them from above. Greedily, it implants its mouth into its prey, engorging itself on the victim’s blood. A Dragon Tick distends to the size of a horse when fully engorged on blood, its soft translucent belly exposed and unprotected. 

*WHAT IS CURIOUS ABOUT THE DRAGON TICK IS THE ALCHEMICAL CHANGES IT MAKES TO THE BLOOD IT DRINKS.* Strange magical properties are imbued into the blood, granting it a healing factor as well as boosting magical capabilities. Because of this, Dragon Tick blood is a hot commodity among the spellcasting community and the bounty for a live specimen can be a small fortune. 

### Abilities
**Blood Drain:** On bite, save versus breath, failure means the Dragon Tick begins to burrow into the body, dealing 1d4 automatic damage each round as it drains the victim’s blood. A successful strength check stops this process by violently ripping the Dragon Tick away

**Adamantine Teeth:** Non-magical armor provides no protection from the Dragon Tick’s bite attack
