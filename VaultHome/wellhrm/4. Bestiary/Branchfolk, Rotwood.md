### Description
Dryadi who lose their Grandmother Tree and fail to find a replacement undergo a horrible degenerative illness. Slowly developing a violent form of dementia, their bodies begin to rot from the inside out. Aggressive, maddened shambles of their former selves, they stalk the Wilds listlessly in mobs, bringing violence wherever they go.

### Abilities
**MOB MENTALITY:** A Rotwood has advantage on attacks against an opponent if another Rotwood is attacking the same target. 
**ROTTED:** Rotwood are immune to poison. 
**VULNERABLE TO FIRE:** Rotwood dry-rotted bodies are vulnerable to fire. They take double damage from fire and they actively flee from it.
