## Description

 Clusters of carnivorous vines that dangle from tree branches, craving blood and flesh. Hooked victims are pulled up to be slowly digested.

▶ Lure: 1d6 corpses of victims hang in the vines, twitching and moaning as the tendrils of the vines penetrate the brains and nervous systems to produce a mockery of life.
▶ Constriction: On a successful hit the vine wraps around the victim, inflicting 1d6 automatic damage each round.
▶ Severing vines: Requires a hit with a cutting weapon inflicting 4 or more damage.
▶ Flammable: Especially susceptible to #fire—suffer double damage.
