## Description
Mummies are #undead and cannot be hit by normal weapons, and even  #magical_weapon cause only half damage. In addition to normal damage, their touch also inflicts [[Mummy Rot]], a #disease that prevents magical healing and causes wounds to heal at one-tenth of the normal rat. A cure disease spell can increase healing rate to one-half normal, but a remove curse spell is required to completely lift the mummyâ€™s curse.
