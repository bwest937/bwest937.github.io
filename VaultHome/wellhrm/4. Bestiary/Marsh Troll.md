## Description

Marsh trolls stand about 7 feet tall and live in marshes, swamps, and bog land throughout Havenland and parts of Oldenwale beyond. They live off giant insects, especially giant gloombugs, and small goblins. Almost exclusively shamanistic, it is rare for them to wear clothing of any kind, instead covering their bodies in tattoos made with ink from gloombugs. This gives them a faint green-hued glow. 

Each tattoo is actually an inscribed clerical spell that the marsh troll has learned. **A marsh troll will have one tattoo for each Hit Dice they possess.** These spells can be cast multiple times, but after casting a number of spells equal to their Hit Dice in a day, they must take an 8-hour rest to recover their energy.

Marsh trolls also have the ability to mesmerise gloombugs and can get them to fly in circles above their heads. On command, these gloombugs can be used to distract attackers, by flying in the faces of opponents and making enemy casters take a saving throw to avoid distraction. The gloombugs can be used to affect up to three opponents. All attackers that fail their saving throws are at -1 on to-hit rolls
