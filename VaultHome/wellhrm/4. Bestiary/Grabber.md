### Description

### Abilities
**Swallow:** If a Four-eyed Grabber bites a small or smaller creature, it must make a saving throw to avoid being swallowed whole. Swallowed creatures suffer 1d4 points of digestive damage per round and are immobilised. Medium and larger creatures are not swallowed, but must make a saving throw to escape the bite. They can attempt this each round. Each round that they are within the jaws of the Grabber, they take an additional 2d6 damage and have a 10% chance per round of having a limb or other body part ripped off.
