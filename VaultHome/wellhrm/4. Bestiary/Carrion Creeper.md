This caterpillar-like creature has 6 waving tentacles which, when they score a hit, require the target to make a saving throw or be paralyzed for 2d6 turns. These underground scavengers can be aggressive when they are hungry, and pursue prey unless distracted. They are good climbers, but when crossing water they are unable to do much more than float with the current.
