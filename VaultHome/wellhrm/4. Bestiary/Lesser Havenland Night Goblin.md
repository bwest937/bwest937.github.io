## Description
**It Burns:** -1 to hit in sunlight or bright light. 
**Shriek:** (twice a day) Causes a saving throw. On failure, drop carried items and cover ears. The Night Goblin cannot do anything else whilst shrieking other than run off. 
**Blinding:** If both claw attacks hit, the goblin can hold on and use its nose attack the following round instead. On a successful nose hit target has a 10% cumulative chance of being blinded. 
**Craving:** Upon seeing a craved food (pick one) from the following list: spiders, cats, stag beetles, slugs, snails, small birds, mice, bread, pork, potatoes, tomatoes, bees, or wasps, the goblin is at -2 to all hit, damage and saving throws until they spend a round eating their craving (cumulative with It Burns)
