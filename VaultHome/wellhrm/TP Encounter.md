1: 5
2: 8
3: 8

a: 7
b: 6
c: 7

## setup
- use chips for height for the wall guys
- use good minis for the ones on the ground, blue meeple or whatever for the others
- let them decide placing (2 searching) and who was on guard since you rushed them
- but the lanterns placement matters! if right in the middle, can see both crews coming
- no surprise

## MORALE please remember

## are the DC's alerted? 
- hrm, i think 2/6 chance
- consequence... i guess they post a guard and ready themselves for... 2 turns?
    - and can;t be heard during this time
- maybe remind them noise begets monsters sometimes
