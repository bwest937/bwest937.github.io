Virtually all gems are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabochon (polished elliptical or round), not faceted.

- This is 5e gems, but has pictures, including of unpolished, which is awesome. 
	- I think jacinth has extra value in 5e vs real world. 
	- skip spinel, all of them used to be rubies
	- Otherwise good enough to roll/guess on probably.
- The rough order is something like sapphire/ruby > emerald/diamond > amethyst/garnet/citrine > pearls > lesser stones (eg jasper)
- size matters, so combine that with unpolished (.6x?) and type to vary descriptions and value
