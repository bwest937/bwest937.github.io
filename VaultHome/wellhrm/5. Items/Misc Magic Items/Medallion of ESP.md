> This magical medallion is strung on a chain and worn around the neck. If the wearer concentrates for 1 round they may read the thoughts of any one creature within range. The wearer may move normally but cannot fight or cast spells while concentrating. The DM must roll 1d6 each time this item is used; it will not work properly on a roll of 1.
