## Armor
Armor comes in lots of different shapes and materials, but in game terms it is classified into categories regardless of the specifics. Armor category directly affects your Movement. Any armor that takes up 2+ slots counts as *heavy* for [[Climbing]] and [[Caving]].

### Armor Descriptions


**Leather:** Armor in this category doesn't lower your movement speed and is usually made from an animal. Examples: Leather, Hide
**Breastplate:** This category is for armor that protects the torso with metal, but isn't full body. Examples: Hauberk (chain shirt), Cuirass
**Chain mail:** Full-body chainmail armor or similar. This is the first type considered *heavy*.
**Brigandine:** This is any full-body armor better than chain but not quite as good as full plate. Brigandine (cloth or leather with metal plates) on the torso plus splint or plate for the limbs is a very effective combination and much cheaper than full plate.
**Plate:** Classic head-to-toe plate armor. Relatively rare in the world. Custom-made versions are even better, and even more pricey.
**Shield:** Standard issue medium shield. Can be splintered to absorb one hit, so carrying backups is a great idea.
