### Armor Descriptions


**Leather:** Armor in this category doesn't lower your movement speed and is usually made from an animal. Examples: Leather, Hide
**Breastplate:** This category is for armor that protects the torso with metal, but isn't full body. Examples: Hauberk (chain shirt), Cuirass, Brigandine (cloth or leather with metal plates).
**Chain mail:** Any full-body metal armor. 
**Brigandine and splint:** This is any full-body armor better than chain but not quite as good as plate. Brigandine on the torso plus splint for the limbs is a very effective combination and much cheaper than plate.
**Plate:** Classic head-to-toe plate armor. Relatively rare in the world. Custom-made versions are even better, and even more pricey.
**Shield:** Standard issue medium shield. Can be splintered to absorb one hit, so carrying backups is a great idea.
