> Smoking lotus coal induces strange dreams and visions for 1d3 hours, and it is very easy to become addicted to it (save vs. poison +4, each dose taken reduces the bonus by -1 until it reaches -2). Addicts need a new dose every 1d3 days or they lose 1 point of both Wis and Con. Taking one dose recovers a point each. Heavy users of Lotus Coal can easily be recognized by the black cataracts in their eyes. One portion is worth 5 gp on the black market.
