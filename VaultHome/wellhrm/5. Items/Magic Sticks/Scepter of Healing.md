> This scepter resembles a wand with a thickened end, and may be used only by a Cleric. When the Cleric touches someone with the wand, he or she will be healed for 1d12-1 HP. If a natural "1" is rolled then the enchantment of the scepter has been exhausted and it will permanently cease to function.
