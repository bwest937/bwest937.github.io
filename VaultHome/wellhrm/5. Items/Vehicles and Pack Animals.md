#### Feed
Hungry animals will require morale checks and/or move slower. Feed is cheap enough in Wellhrm to not be worth tracking the gp, but the slots do matter.

##### Design Notes
This will need reworked and expanded if ever hex-crawling proper. Horses are around just dont expect them to be used much by the party in Wellhrm. Used S&W Vehicle Rates and checked multiple systems for slot math after converting to "units of chain mail". Feed slots is 100% vibes.
